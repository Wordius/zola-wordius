‘Get, down’ (from the worktop), ‘Get, out’ (of the food cupboard), ‘Get, off’ (of the kitchen table), ‘Get, away’ (from the person who has just walked through our front door). Anyone visiting our house would be surprised our dog’s name isn’t ‘Get’!

But it’s not. She’s called Dotty, and her name explains everything. Dotty’s issues extend beyond the ‘trivial’ points mentioned earlier. She’s what is known as a ‘reactive’ dog. And, hence, we find ourselves making our way to Developing Dogs, in the beautiful countryside surrounding Ely.

Developing Dogs was set up by Sian Ryan, the training and behaviour expert from BBC2’s *Me and My Dog*. Its aim is to develop your relationship with your canine companion, give you the tools to understand each other and help your puppy or dog develop the life skills that make them part of the family.

Dotty is an otherwise loving dog, who’s great to have around. She’s great around other dogs, but not when on the lead. Unfortunately, for us and her, on the lead is where she stays most of the time. She is easily distracted and thinks nothing of giving chase to hares, and letting nothing get in her way, including barbed wire. There were a number of such incidents that led to visits to the vets. That’s when we realised she had to stay on the lead, unless we could find an enclosed field.

It just so happens that Developing Dogs has such a field, which was what attracted us to it in the first place. The Pond Field, as it’s known, backs onto the three cottages owned by Developing Dogs, and it is entirely secure. You get your own private entrance, through two gates from your garden, and an allotted time, which means you never come face to face with another dog.

Our first evening there, we had the field reserved for 5.30pm. So, just as one of the other dog owners was leaving the field, we ventured out, our two trusty lurchers unaware of what was in store. We walked on lead for a time before letting the dogs off for a good run around.

And run around they did. Dotty started by checking out every corner of the field’s three acres, then scattering all of the rabbits. It wasn’t long before she realised there was no way out. And Roma and her began to play chase, every now and then coming back to us for a treat. Then they discovered the pond!

The pond was more mud bath than pond. And our dogs loved it, charging in and out while chasing one another. With our time in the field coming to an end, we encouraged the dogs back to us and put them on their leads. Time for a shower, methinks.

Back in our garden, we were equipped for this. Hot and cold water outlets and a good dose of Fox Pooh shampoo, and our white lurchers were looking clean again. We allowed them to dry off a bit before letting them back in the cottage, and, funnily enough, that was the last time they ever went in the pond despite visiting it twice a day over the course of the next two days.

It was at this point that we realised just how well equipped our little cottage was. Besides the Fox Pooh shampoo, there were pooh bags, dog towels, dog treats and name tags (that indicated they were staying at Developing Dogs), and a mister designed to calm dogs.

We were staying in Dragonfly, the middle of the three cottages. It has a large double with a super king-size bed, a wet room with a walk-in shower and bath, and a comfortable lounge cum dining space cum kitchen, equipped with everything you could possibly need. There’s also a large hallway and a storage cupboard for coats and shoes. The lounge has a large TV and DVD player and a number of games and books. There’s also a large throw for the couch, in case your dog should make himself at home, and an equally large one for the bed.

The other cottages have two beds and one is suitable for wheelchair access.

The next morning, after walking around the field – for which a pair of wellies would have proved useful – we checked out the weather. It was somewhat ‘changeable’, I think we agreed, by which we British mean pockets of sunshine, interspersed by long, dark spells of torrential rain. The coast looked more promising, so we decided to head for Holkham, a beach we had heard a lot about but had never been to.

### Holkham National Nature Reserve and Beach

On arriving at Holkham, the sun decided to pop out, however briefly. Now there was simply the ominous task of getting to the beach, past all the dogs without Dotty reacting too much. To our surprise, she didn’t. She was much too interested in all the new smells and, of course, the rabbits.

Once safely down on the beach, we marched up the channel that leads to the shoreline to be confronted by, well, horses. It seemed we’d chosen the exact time the Queen’s Household Cavalry were exercising their horses. So it was dogs on leads time again, lest they got over-excited and gave chase. All the Queen’s horses and all the Queen’s men couldn’t have put a horse back together again once our two had finished with them!

Concluding that the dogs had had more than enough exercise anyway – with Dotty’s training still to come and they’re evening walk to go – we headed back to the car, but not before stopping off at Holkham’s stunning Lookout Cafe, which won a RIBA East award in May 2019.

It was raining by the time we got back to the car, so we decided to head back to Developing Dogs and our training session, which you can read about in the separate panel – just replace Dotty’s name with your dog’s name and you’re good to go.

After our training session, we were back in the field for a brief walk. After which most of us, dogs included, were tuckered out. My wife, on the other hand, had other things on her mind. A dip in Dragonfly’s hot tub, for one, with a chilled glass of Prosecco to go with it.

### What will the weather do?

Our second day began much like the first – checking the weather before heading out for a walk around the field. By this point, we’d worked out you could easily fit in two loops of the field during your half hour. The second time around we stopped off at a jumps course, set out for the dogs. After a little bit of encouragement, the dogs got the hang of it. It was a case of the tortoise meets the hare. Dotty would charge over all the jumps, just excited to get to the end. Meanwhile Roma would lope along behind, and gently take the treat from my hand. Dotty was oblivious.

With the weather unable to make up it’s mind, we decided on a day out in Ely before visiting the outlaws. Ely is definitely worth checking out, if even just to see the cathedral. It is absolutely staggering to behold.

Back in our garden that evening, we were acutely aware of just how well thought out Developing Dogs have made their holiday homes. While all sit close together, they are all completely detached, even the gardens. There’s a large area of astro turf, surrounded by pebbles and six-foot black-painted fences on all three sides, enough to contain any dog. A gate at the bottom of the garden leads to a dead space, before another gate opens onto Pond Field. Human visitors aren’t neglected either, with a barbecue and comfortable outdoor seating should the weather play ball!

All in all, we figured our visit to Developing Dogs was a success, both for us and our dogs, and despite the weather.

### Training the Developing Dogs way

#### Our training session took place inside, thankfully

##### Check-in

Have a handful of food and let Dotty sniff it. Raise this hand out to the side – Dotty will likely look at it. We are waiting for her to take her eyes off of the hand and look at your face, when she does mark with a word (e.g. ‘good’) and then release a treat to her.

You can make this harder by lowering you hand so it is closer to her, or you could do it with two hands out to each side.

##### Check-in around the bowl

This exercise we started at a distance from one another. Dotty was on-lead and I put a bowl on the floor with some treats in. You stand still and wait for her to look round and back at you. As soon as she does, mark that with a word (e.g. ‘good’), then take her lead off and tell her to go and get what’s in the bowl.

Progress this by reducing the distance between you and the bowl. This is a good exercise for reinforcing the check-in behaviour, which may be useful when there is another dog at a distance that she can cope with, so she can look at the other dog and then check in with you.

##### Ball game

Remember that before we can use it as reinforcement, we need to teach the game first. For this, you will need two identical balls (that your dog likes, e.g. two squeaky balls, two rabbit balls, two bouncy balls, etc.) so that one doesn’t hold more value than the other.

Throw a ball out to one side for your dog, when they go to pick it up, encourage them (don’t use their recall cue, though) to come back towards you, when they are close, ask them to drop (just say it once) and show the other ball; as soon as they drop the ball in their mouth throw the other ball out to the other side for them to get. Then repeat.

The idea of this game is getting fluidity of chase on the go so that we can offer it as motivation to come back to us later down the line (where food might not cut it).

You can buy rabbit balls from Sporting Saint from sportingsaint.co.uk/product/678.

##### Self control around flirt pole

This was the exercise where I had the flirt pole at the other end of the barn and made it move around a little. When we first did it, we were too close and Dotty couldn’t take her eyes off of it, and even barked at it. We then added some more distance, and she coped a lot better. What we were looking at doing was having the toy moving around and when she takes her eyes off and checks in, you pay her for that. We are paying her for being calm and being able to take her eyes off of the exciting stimulus.

### Sian’s top tips for dealing with a reactive dog
1. Your dog is barking and lunging at other dogs for a reason, and the behaviour works for them or they wouldn't keep doing it. The most common reasons for reacting to other dogs are fear - where your dog’s behaviour is designed to increase distance between them and the other dog - and frustration because the lead is stopping them from getting closer to the other dog. Frustrated dogs may be absolutely fine around other dogs when off lead. Some dogs have a mix of fear and frustration - where they want to rush at the other dog to drive them away, but the lead stops them.

2. Practice makes perfect, so every time your dog barks and lunges at another dog they are refining their coping mechanism of their barking and lunging techniques, and developing the habitual behaviour. Barking and lunging becomes just what they do when they see another dog, and they may no longer actually feel afraid or frustrated because their coping mechanism works.

3. To reduce or eliminate the barking and lunging we need to change how your dog feels around other dogs, to remove the need for the barking and lunging. Using any kind of aversive technique, from shouting ‘No’, jerking the lead or rattle bottles, to air canisters and spray collars, simply suppresses the behaviour and more than likely leaves your dog not only fearful or frustrated around other dogs but also feeling uncomfortable around you but unable to show how they feel for fear of something bad happening to them.

4. The first step in changing behaviour is preventing them from practising the behaviour we’re trying to change. This potentially means walking in different places where you see fewer/no dogs, or at different times when it’s less busy. Don’t put your dog in a situation where they can’t cope and have no choice but to react.

5. While avoiding dogs on walks, you can then start to work on changing how they feel about other dogs in controlled situations where they are exposed to other dogs at a distance that enables them to relax and learn.
