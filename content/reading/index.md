<div class="page-intro"> 
<p class="larger">Not quite all the books I’ve ever read. My particular favourites show up as links. Those links lead to Amazon, which in turn provides me with a few pence for recommending them. It all goes toward the upkeep of this blog.</p>
<p class="larger">We all go through different phases in life, including our choice of reading. One minute a subject or author might be fashionable, the next it’s not.</p>

- [Bombay Taxi](https://amzn.to/3wXRvz4), John Ramsay&emsp;&ensp;*A top notch read even if it’s not by a top author. Tells the story of the London barrow boy’s family’s overland journey from England to Australia in the 1950s. I particularly liked the way they turned up at the RAC in London to get a road map – old-school Google Maps – for their journey.*
