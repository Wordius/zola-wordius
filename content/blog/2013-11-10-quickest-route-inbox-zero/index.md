Many critics claim that [email has had its day](http://www.iod.com/connect/technology/articles/the-post-email-era-and-what-it-means-for-business ). I disagree. Email is still the most popular tool I have for communicating with clients and contractors; the reverse is also true. Clients tend to contact me first by email. Often, an entire job completes without a single telephone conversation to interrupt the flow.

That said, email is not without its problems. An inbox chock full of newsletters, service reminders and social media communications is distracting and unproductive. You can quickly lose track of all the important stuff.

Earlier this week I read a post on one of the technology sites. It described a very simple email filter (or rule), which steers every email containing the word ‘unsubscribe’ away from your inbox and into a folder called ‘Bulk mail’. Most newsletters and service reminders contain the word ‘unsubscribe’, so it sounded worth a shot. I already use a number of other filters to channel messages from social media sites away from my inbox.

Mail.app has a handy rules implementation, but my current Mac client of choice, Airmail, doesn’t. Fortunately, if I head up the chain of command to my email provider, [FastMail](http://www.fastmail.fm/?STKI=11717993), I can set up a filter, or rule, in FastMail’s web interface. I like this approach. By applying the rule in FastMail, it feels like all the junk that ordinarily bungs up my inbox is even further removed. The messages are still there – the ‘Bulk mail’ folder syncs to Airmail on my Mac – but my inbox is much tidier and reserved for important messages. For the record, you can achieve the same in Gmail, but I’ve recently dropped Gmail for a number of reasons, including the ads, the [complicity](http://gizmodo.com/how-google-gives-your-information-to-the-nsa-512840958), and the desire for more control. That meant paying for my email service.

It’s very easy to set up. If you use FastMail, log in to your account, create a folder called **Bulk mail** then head to **Mail > Settings > Advanced > Define Rules**. The screenshot below shows how I’ve defined the rule as follows:

* Toggle the dropdown in the ‘Message with’ column to ‘Body’.
* Change the dropdown in the ‘That’ column to ‘contains’.
* Insert the word ‘Unsubscribe’ in ‘The text’ field. 
* Toggle the ‘File into folder’ dropdown to show the ‘Bulk mail’ folder you created earlier).
* Click ‘Add’ followed by ‘Save changes’, then ‘Apply all changes’. You’ll find the latter button towards the top of the page under the ‘Define rules’ heading.

The added bonus is that I don’t see any of this ‘bulk mail’ on my iPhone. [Dispatch](http://www.dispatchapp.net), the action-based email client I use on my iPhone, only shows the content of my inbox.
