When I posted ‘Harbingers of editorial change’ earlier this week, I hadn’t come across Nathan Kontny’s [Draft](http://ninjasandrobots.com/draft-preview-uber-for-writing).

Draft is a Markdown writing tool with the ability to share with an editor built into the interface. Your editor can suggest changes, but you decide whether to accept or reject those changes in your finished work.

Regardless of how well we write, having a fresh pair of eyes glance over our work can bring many benefits; even an editor needs an editor.

Kontny is sending out beta invites to trial Draft prior to the public release.
