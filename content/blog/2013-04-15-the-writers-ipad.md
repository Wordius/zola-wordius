A lot has been written about the iPad as a Mac replacement. Back in February, in ‘[The iPad can be a true Mac alternative](http://shawnblanc.net/2013/02/the-ipad-can-be-a-true-mac-alternative/)’, instead Shawn Blanc put the case for the iPad as “a Mac alternative”:

For me, it all boils down to what I’m doing and where I’m doing it. If my iPad is close to hand – usually the case when I’m sitting in my living room – and I want to tap out a few notes, that’s what I use. I don’t up sticks and head for my office every time I want to capture a passing thought.

Thord Daniel Hedengren’s new ebook, *The Writer’s iPad*, is aimed at anyone who wants to make the most of Apple’s tablet as a writing tool. Within, he covers some of the best apps for writing, offers tips on writing accessories, advice on iPad set up, and discusses a number of other useful tools for writers.

Even if you’re not a full-time writer, chances are Hedengren’s advice and recommendations will bring the kind of productivity improvements you wouldn't have thought possible.

*The Writer’s iPad* is available as a Kindle edition for [$3.99](http://amzn.to/11gRtbO) ([£2.72](http://amzn.to/10XmGQ5)). PDF and ePub versions are available directly from the publisher for the same price.
