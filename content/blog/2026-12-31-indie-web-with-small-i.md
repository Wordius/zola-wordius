For a short time this blog was part of the IndieWeb that vast sprawling network of websites that considers itself as separate from the corporate web. They publish on their own site first then, optionally, elsewhere. In that way they ‘own’ their content. And no one can take that away. Which is all good.

But then I switched the way I serve this site, and any interest I had in being part of the IndieWeb waned. In other words, it became too much of a chore to set up POSSEing, microformats, webmentions and comments. So, somewhat like [Chris Walker](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/), I consider this site part of the ‘indie web’, or part of nothing, whichever you prefer.

It fulfils the three tenets of the IndieWeb. They are:

- Set up a domain (I have a number of domains, which explains why I haven’t blogged on this site in over a year. Could do better)
- Set up hosting
- Create pages (I use [Zola](https://getzola.org)), and have fun.

But, the fact is, I don’t need, or want, to be part of a group or a community. All I do is create pages, share them on social media (sometimes, and not Twitter, obviously), and that’s me done. Apart from the occasional email to respond to.

I realise there are those who might feel differently. They may want to be part of a community. If so, then the IndieWeb Carnival, hosted this month by [VH Belvadi](https://vhbelvadi.com/indieweb-carnival-future), may be for you. Everything is there for you to participate, including some helpful hints on how to get involved.

So, if nothing else came out of this morning’s reading, I added two more interesting feeds to my [reader](https://netnewswire.com/). And I blogged again.
