I read a lot about [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) before I even bought the app. My resistance eventually wore thin. So what is Hazel? According to Hazel’s developer, Noodlesoft:

> Hazel is a System Preference pane that works silently in the background, automatically filing, organizing and cleaning.

What’s more, it’s simple to use. Start with a few basic rules, such as filing movie and image files automatically; when time allows, build up to the mother of all rules to strip out time-consuming tasks from your workflow.

The links below are provided as a resource for newcomers to Hazel[^1]. Expect some fine-tuning as I mould it into the definitive reading list for beginners:

* [Mac Power Users: Hazel 3.0](http://macpowerusers.com/2012/04/mpu-79-hazel-3-0/): in covering the latest release, the MPU crew go over some basics and favourite workflows (video). 
* [Why I started using Hazel for Mac](http://www.macstories.net/stories/why-i-started-using-hazel-for-mac/): MacStories’ Federico Viticci explains how he got started using Hazel – less a tutorial, more an affirmation of how useful Hazel can be.
* [Hazel – the personal housekeeper on your Mac](http://www.asianefficiency.com/technology/hazel-the-personal-housekeeper-on-your-mac/): covers basic set-up, dealing with PDFs and ebooks, and OmniFocus backups.
* [Setting up a basic Mac media server](http://shawnblanc.net/2013/02/setting-up-a-basic-mac-media-server/): Hazel plays a small, but important, part in Shawn Blanc’s home media set-up.
* [Seven amazing uses for Hazel](http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/seven_amazing_uses_hazel): included because I particularly liked two of the suggested workflows: archive a project and highlight unused apps.
* [Managing files with Hazel](http://hackmake.org/2012/09/mac-brain-managing-files-with-hazel): Hack/Make blogger Nick Wynja on his archive and document folder structure, filing and importing bank statements to Evernote, and organising plain-text notes.
* [How I use Hazel](http://productivityist.com/how-i-use-hazel/): Productivityist Mike Vardy on zapping apps, organising files and rules for sharing.
* [Create OmniFocus tasks with AppleScript](http://macsparky.com/2012/8/applescript-omnifocus-tasks): David Sparks uses Hazel in a workflow that reminds him how to pay his insurance bill on time. 
* [Create OmniFocus tasks via Hazel, redux](http://patricklenz.com/posts/create-omnifocus-tasks-via-hazel-redux): inspired by David Sparks, Patrick Lenz adopts a single-system approach and applies a general rule that reminds him to pay random bills. 

In future posts I will share some of my own uses for Hazel.
