Kev Quirk’s [journalling app ](https://kevquirk.com/blog/building-a-simple-journal) is genius. I like the way he thinks. He doesn’t want, or need, the likes of the Day One journalling app, “too much going on, and I don't like the fact I'm sending my journal to a 3rd party”. Agreed on that.

All he wanted was something simple, that worked anywhere, whether he was just going to bed and had his phone to hand, or at his desk looking forward to ‘yet another great’ day in the office! 

All that’s needed is to add a password-protected login page, much like the one below, and you’ve got yourself your own private, no-nonsense journal.

He’s also included parsedown, a fast, extensible markdown parser for PHP, so you can write your thoughts in Markdown, as you always have, haven’t you. The text box grows so if you get a bit carried away with your thoughts, you can just keep on writing.

All you are advised to do is edit the config.php file to change the title and description. You can also upload your own favicon in place of that supplied.
