If there is one thing that’s as good as free or open source software, it is coming across hardware that’s built to last. Even if it’s not free.

I bought a mouse by Logitech in March 2016, a T630 Ultrathin Touch model. It cost what seemed a lot at the time for a mere mouse – £46.99. But, get this, it’s still in use  today. All it needs is a recharge every couple of weeks, depending on the usage.

In that time, of course, we have fallen out with one another – usually because it failed to connect with my bluetooth. So, I’ve bought a couple of products, including among them an Apple Magic mouse, seen them end up in the trash, returned to using my Logitech mouse, and it still works, once I can get it chattering away with the bluetooth on my Mac.

It is tiny, about half the size of an Apple Magic mouse, but it is a rugged, solid piece of kit that I wouldn’t want to be without.

It is no longer available from Logitech, but there are still a number of items listed on eBay, still at roughly the same price I paid in 2016. As an alternative [Logitech’s MX Master 3S](https://amzn.to/4d3ghO2) is the firm’s latest model. It’s a more complex, larger beast, with more moving parts – read, more things that can go wrong. But, if it is as solidly built as the Ultrathin, you can expect it to last. 

My advice would be to get in there now, before Logitech launches a [subscription model or similar](https://www.theverge.com/24206847/logitech-ceo-hanneke-faber-mouse-keyboard-gaming-decoder-podcast-interview).
