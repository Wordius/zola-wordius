Okay, so the title of this post might not exactly ring true. But let’s assume I didn’t work in publishing, the reason a number of other apps – [Adobe Design Premium](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-6761979-10469484), a good text editor, a browser, to name a few – are important in my great scheme.

In such a scenario, the app I would live by – although not necessarily in – is [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword), a password manager for Mac and iOS. Having both versions allows you to sync passwords (and other secure information) between desktop, iPhone and iPad. Every time you create a new website login, 1Password will prompt you to store that information. The prompting can be annoying at first, but diminishes in time.

I spend a lot of time in the browser. 1Password is the app that propels me from one thing to the next; it’s like having a chauffeur to drive you around the web. I suppose I could do something similar with bookmarks, but it wouldn’t be nearly as quick, and it certainly wouldn’t be as secure.

With 1Password, you only have to remember [one password](href="http://productivityist.com/the-1password-emergency-kit/), hence, well you get the picture… The login information for each site is stored away and using the built-in password generator ensures every password is different, and complex.

Security is one thing – and an important thing at that – but, for me, the real beauty is in the way 1Password speeds up almost every action I take.

## 1Password in action

As an example, I had to grab the link for the image of the 1Password dropdown, above, from my Flickr account. Here is what that action would look like *without* 1Password:

* Click Flickr bookmark, assuming it’s in your browser menu bar. If it’s not, drill down into your bookmarks until you find it.
* Click login link.
* Type username.
* Type insecure password, assuming it’s the same one you use on most every website you access and, therefore, easy to remember. Or, type secure password after ferreting around in the back of a drawer to find the ‘notebook that must never be lost’.
* Hit return (↩) or click submit.

And *with* 1Password:

* Hold down `⌘ ⌥ \`.
* Type f-l-i – that’s all I need to type to single out Flickr from all the other websites that reside in my login list.
* Hit return (↩).

1Password does the rest, adding and submitting your login information. It’s like magic, and makes me smile every time. My wife says I don’t smile enough; she’d think different if she witnessed all those 1P moments.

## What else?

When I’m not focused on a browser, I access my 1Password logins using [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com), a productivity app for OS X. Alfred is free, but you need to buy the Powerpack (£15) to use it with 1Password.

Secure logins isn’t the only use for 1Password. You can also use it to store: Account information (AWS, Database, Email, FTP, ISP, Server); Identities (for your multiple personas, e.g. separating the personal information you use for work and play); Secure Notes; Software (all those easily forgotten licence keys); and Wallet (bank accounts, credit cards).

I’ve been using 1Password for over a year. To say I would be lost without it is far more than a mere understatement.
