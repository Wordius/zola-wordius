In an article for The Sweet Setup, Nick Heer rates VSCO Cam (App Store) and Snapseed (App Store) as being among the best photo-editing apps for the iPhone. He also warns:
 
> [T]rust your eyes. Rely on VSCO Cam to enhance the best qualities of an image, not to replace them. It’s really, really good at doing just that.<br>

I agree with Heer’s choices. VSCO Cam is the app I use most of the time, but I occasionally reach for Snapseed, especially when I want to take advantage of its ‘drama’ filter.

Both apps are free, although VSCO Cam sells additional filters in-app.
