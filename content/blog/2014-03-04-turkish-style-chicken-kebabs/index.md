Every now and then I get the urge to replicate food I buy from a takeaway at home. One of my favourite takeaways is fresh chicken kebabs, cooked over coals with onions, peppers and mushrooms, and served in a warmed pitta bread with chilli sauce. 

The ‘cooked over coals’ part might be difficult to achieve at this time of year, with the barbecue packed away for winter, so a griddle pan will have to do. A [heavy, cast-iron griddle pan](https://amzn.to/4bpuzaH) is best. Then the important thing is to make sure it’s hot, smoking hot even, before you add the chicken – a little bit of charring is what we’re looking for.

### Ingredients

* 2 chicken breasts
* 1 medium onion, chopped into chunks
* 1 garlic clove, minced or finely chopped
* 1 green pepper, sliced
* 1 onion, sliced
* 6 mushrooms, halved
* 200ml plain yoghurt
* 2tsp cumin
* 1tsp chilli powder
* 1tbsp olive oil
* four spring (salad) onions, chopped
* salt and pepper to taste
* **Serves: 2**

### Instructions

1. Prepare your marinade by mixing together cumin and chilli powder, minced garlic, plain yoghurt, olive oil, spring onions, salt and pepper in a medium-sized bowl.
2. Cut the chicken breasts into chunks about &frac12;in by &frac12;in and add to the marinade.
3. Place the bowl, lid on, in the fridge for a minimum of two hours, but preferably overnight.
4. In the absence of coals, my griddle pan did a fine job. Add a drop of olive oil, heat the pan till it smokes, add the chicken, flip after 4mins. After a further 3mins break up any chunks you think might not be cooked through and add the onions, mushrooms and peppers. Cook for another 3mins. 
5. Remove to a bowl lined with kitchen paper and allow to rest for a minute.
6. Toast a wholemeal pitta.
7. Slot the kebab into the toasted pitta and serve with salad and humus. 

The pleasure on my face was witnessed by three drooling cats – the fourth doesn’t like chilli!
