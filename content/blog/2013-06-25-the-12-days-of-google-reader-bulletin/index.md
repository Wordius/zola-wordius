Bulletin is a new Google Reader replacement, very new. Beta testing began in early May and, as I write, Bulletin only went public 17 hours ago. It’s yet another example of what you can do when you put your mind to it. Like many others, Atlanta-based Michael Cantrell and Daniel Andrews received Google’s news back in March with little more than a shred of an idea in the works. Suddenly they had a deadline. 

First impressions are important, and Bulletin impresses immediately. The site’s front page, with its clean, crisp design, was intriguing enough to get me to sign up on the spot instead of heading for bed, which is where I was going when [Twitter pinged](https://twitter.com/danielandrews/status/349268651301539840).

Not for the first time, my basic outline for this series changed.

### Interface

Here’s why.

Cantrell and Andrews started with the blank canvas that was Google Reader – albeit one that did the job – and injected some personality. The design has an edge that was lacking in Google Reader, but it’s not so damned edgy that it makes you want to cry. (Feedly made me want to cry when I first saw it, then I realised I could tweak out some of the madness in settings.) Bulletin’s design shows that they’ve thought about what RSS users want before attempting to provide a solution – it looks right, it feels right, it works.

Of course, not everything is a perfect fit and some features have yet to be rolled out, such as filtering. There are also some minor adjustments that would improve usability. For instance, the metadata – the date and time – in the collapsed view of feeds (above) is subsidiary to the post title. The designer has attempted to achieve this by tinting the black; I don’t think it’s enough. The metadata should assume the position, below the title. It would also be useful to see the article source included as part of the metadata. I often view my feeds by folder or ‘All feeds’. Having the source would help ascertain who had written what; as an example, you get a lot of duplicate content from different authors in the Apple sphere; favicons can be useful in this respect, but they’re not always enough. 

When scrolling through feeds, there are two views, three if you count ‘Open entry link in a new tab’ (shortcut key: `v`). A halfway house beteen the currently available ‘collapsed’ (shortcut key: `1`) and ‘expanded’ (`2`, below) states – maybe one that shows the first two lines of each article – would be useful. Headline writing is an art, but we’re not all great artists.

In expanded view there are three default sharing options – Twitter, Facebook and App.net – accessible by clicking on the sharing panel icon below the star on the left of the article (`shift+s` opens the sharing panel). The remaining options are added when you enable them under ‘Account’, found in the menu below the list of feeds. The full list of sharing options is:

* Share to Instapaper (shift+1)
* Share to Pocket (shift+2)
* Share to Pinboard (shift+3)
* Share to Twitter (shift+4)
* Share to Facebook (shift+5)
* Share to App.net (shift+6).

I’ve mentioned some shortcuts already. You can see the rest in an overlay (shortcut key: `?`), shown below.

### What’s up?

Filtering, tagging, first-party apps and support from third-party app developers (syncing) are not available in the current version.

Advanced filtering (search) and discovery tools are said to be ‘next up’, as are first-party apps for iOS, which will come free with a subscription. The Bulletin team also say they are in talks with third-party app developers. It would be interesting to know which ones, but it’s understandable why this information isn’t being shared.

On a minor point, every time I use the help shortcut, `?`, both showing and hiding the shortcuts, an alert tells me ‘Pocket is not configured’. What if you don’t want to configure Pocket? I don’t, but I did just to stop the nagging. 

### Cost

A subscription to Bulletin costs $2 per month or $16 per year, pretty much in line with what is being charged by other services. Feed Wrangler, for instance, charges $18.99, while BazQux Reader allows you to set your own price – $9, $19 or $29 – for the same level of service.

### Conclusion

For me, search and tagging are not an issue. I don’t expect to change my current set up from reading RSS feeds on an iPad to reading them in the web interface, no matter how much I like the look of it. 

But for users whose day-to-day relationship with their RSS feeds is through a web interface, access to search and tagging functions will be of paramount importance. On the basis of what I’ve seen so far, including some fixes that have been implemented in the short, few hours I’ve had to play with Bulletin, I don’t doubt that the team are on the case. 

That leaves me with one question: Which third-party apps will support Bulletin?
