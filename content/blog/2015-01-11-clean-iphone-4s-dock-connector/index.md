For the past couple of months, I’ve been having problems charging my iPhone 4S. Initially, I thought it must be due to a bent pin, possibly the result of using a cheap cable when trying to charge my phone in the car. I bought more cables, but the problem persisted, as the connection between the cable and the dock connector became increasingly difficult to achieve.

Then I came across Michael Burgstaller’s guide on [How to clean your dock connector on your iDevice](https://snapguide.com/guides/clean-your-dock-connector-on-your-idevice/). Seems, all along, the problem was pocket fluff gathering in the dock connector’s open end. Within a few minutes, aided by a cocktail stick, I had removed all of the pocket fluff – all three-plus years-worth of it.

All those cables I bought weren’t entirely useless. One in particular stands out as a great find – Juice’s 30-pin USB charger with mains adapter. Compatible with the iPhone 3/3G/4/4S, iPad 1/2 and iPods with 30-pin connectors, Juice’s piece of kit has a clean, functional, sturdy design. It currently costs [£13.90](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ARAZ1EI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00ARAZ1EI&linkCode=as2&tag=wordius-21&linkId=D3PZCJAV5DUCZDFC) from Amazon (UK only, I think). Apple’s [official power adapter and cable](http://store.apple.com/uk/accessories/all-accessories/charging-devices) costs more than £20, making Juice’s version something of a bargain, I’d say.
