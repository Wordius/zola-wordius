*Logobook* is a 776-page, 5.5lb giant of a book by Ludovic Houplain, co-director of Academy award-winning animated short [*Logorama*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1563725/?ref\_=fn\_al\_tt\_1). The short film’s success in 2009 made it a point of reference for corporate culture.

Publisher Taschen says:

> The monumental archive Houplain amassed is the foundation of this ultimate logo reference guide, featuring approximately 7,000 specimens organized alphabetically, with information about the designers, year of creation, country, brand, and company. Moreover, the book includes an extensive critical essay on brand culture by French philosopher Gilles Lipovetsky, and an introduction by Ludovic Houplain explaining the creation process of the film Logorama, from its inception to its finalization.
