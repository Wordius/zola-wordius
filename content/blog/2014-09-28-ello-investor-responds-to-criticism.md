David Cohen: 

> It’s been interesting to see all the discussion of whether the goals of ello are compatible with the goals of their investors. Since my goal is simply to support great founders, I think there’s no issue. I’ve always been one to invest in people with great ideas who put their users first and are looking to make the world a better place. That’s why I’m a small investor in ello (our fund invested about 9 months ago). We were at that time and still are fully aware of and committed to the [manifesto](https://ello.co/wtf/post/manifesto). In fact, I remember it being the first thing they showed me. Anyone that has worked directly with us knows that we never pressure exits. We’re long term investors and we fundamentally believe ello’s vision and beliefs are good for the world. This belief coupled with our relationship with the founders are the basis for our investment. Clearly ello strikes a chord, and we’re glad to see that. In the end, it’s how ello behaves and stays true to themselves and to their users that will matter. I’m confident that this will play out well.

I hope it plays out well for Ello, too. But venture capitalists don’t just give money away, they invest – and investors expect a return.
