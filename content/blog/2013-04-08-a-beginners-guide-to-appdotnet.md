ADN user [@po](https://alpha.app.net/po) has compiled a list of tips and tools to get new users of the network up and running.
 
The list covers threads, messaging, blogging, widgets, media, search and discovery, notifications, RSS feeds, and more.

I particularly like Longposts. Forget 140 characters, forget even ADN’s 256-character limit, how about 8000? That’s the flexibility you get with the [LongPosts](http://longposts.com/about) instant blogging system. When you publish, a title and link to your long post is instantly sent to ADN; the long post itself becomes part of the ADN post’s metadata. Longposts supports Markdown.
