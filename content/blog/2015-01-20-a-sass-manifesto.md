Felicity Evans explains her [vision for Sass](http://alistapart.com/article/a-vision-for-our-sass) on A List Apart:

> [A]longside the wide-scale adoption of Sass (which I applaud), I’ve observed a steady decline in the quality of outputted CSS (which I bemoan). It makes sense: Sass introduces a layer of abstraction between the author and the stylesheets. But we need a way to translate the web standards—that we fought so hard for—into this new environment. The problem is, the Sass specification is expanding so much that any set of standards would require constant revision. Instead, what we need is a charter—one that sits outside Sass, yet informs the way we code.

A few years ago when I started using a CSS preprocessor, I went with [Less](http://lesscss.org/features/), because it was the one  [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) had adopted. Soon afterwards, I switched to [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), because it was getting the most press (okay, Twitter mentions). For a short period I continued using Twitter Bootstrap, but with Chris Epstein’s [official Sass port of Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass). Eventually, I lost the will to Bootstrap.

My attention switched to alternative frameworks, first [Compass](http://compass-style.org), then [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), then [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net), then [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io), all of which are based on Sass.

Am I glad I switched to Sass.
