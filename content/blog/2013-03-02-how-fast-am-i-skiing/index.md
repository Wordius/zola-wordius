In the 14 years I’ve been skiing, there are two questions to which I’ve always wanted to know the answers:

*   How fast?
*   How far?

Now I know.

During a week of skiing in France’s [Le Grand Massif](http://winter.grand-massif.com), iPhone app Ski Tracks (available on iPhone) provided the answers, along with a lot of other stuff that may be of interest to more serious skiers.

Ski Tracks is a GPS track recorder. When you’re ready to set off down a run, launch the app, press start and stow your iPhone in a pocket. Ski Tracks has a built-in proximity sensor that turns off the screen when it’s placed it a pocket. At the bottom of the run, press pause; save the track if you want to review and compare it with other tracks later.

For each run, Ski Tracks records maximum and average speeds, distance covered (in miles or kilometres), ski vertical (feet or metres), maximum and minimum altitude, slope angle, and time taken. You can add photos to a track, share it on Facebook, and view graphs of your track that plot speed and altitude against time.

If you’ve ever used a track recorder before, you’ll know they tend to drain the iPhone’s battery in quicktime. Ski Tracks has a useful battery monitor setting that automatically switches off tracking when the battery reaches a certain level; that level can be adjusted in settings. Out in the mountains, it’s always a good idea to have some means of communicating with others.

Ski Tracks provided far more information than I first thought I needed, including the fact that I was a lot slower than I’d imagined, but my inner nerd is satisfied.
