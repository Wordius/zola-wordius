In the past, usually when I was starting a new web project, I would find myself rootling around trying to find the HTML codes or Unicodes for the odd glyph or two. It was annoying and a waste of time, which is why I decided to store those I use most often in a Markdown note.

The screenshot below shows a random selection of glyphs taken from a larger table in the same file. I compiled the table in [MultiMarkdown Composer 2](http://multimarkdown.com) and can easily access it with a handful of keyboard strokes in [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com). It takes a lot less time than rootling around the web and scanning table after table until I find what I’m looking for.

I was reminded of this little system when I came across Amit Jain’s [Simbol](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/simbol/id792334901?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l4We), a free iPhone app, that provides quick access to HTML and entity encodings for glyphs, most of which you’ll never use, and some of which will make you scratch your head wondering what in the hell you’d ever want to use them for. Simbol doesn’t include the Unicodes, which I think would be a useful addition.

Still, I thought it was worth mentioning.
