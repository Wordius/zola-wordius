This useful [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html) snippet is courtesy of Michael Schechter, in [Naming Files And Avoiding Folders](http://bettermess.com/naming-files-and-avoiding-folders/).

In TextExpander, Schechter uses the following abbreviation:

`bX`

and pairs it with this plain text snippet:

`Blogx – %| – %y-%m-%d`

When called, the snippet inserts your keyword and current date, and leaves you with a blinking cursor – in place of ‘Type Your Title Here’ – ready for you to complete your file name:

`Blogx – Type Your Title Here – 12-12-28 `

I bought TextExpander in early 2012. It’s one of a number of apps that I expect to stay with me through 2013 and beyond. 

Schechter’s blog, A Better Mess, is packed with useful workflow tips and other advice, all in the name of Getting Things Done.
