Eight years ago my wife bought her parents an iMac. At the time, they were in their early Seventies, and they’d never used a computer. It took me less time than it takes to cook a Sunday roast to download a few essentials and teach them how to use their new window on the world. Their needs were basic: email, letter writing and surfing the web. In the intervening years, the ‘tech calls’ have been few and far between, and usually related to failing peripherals, such as routers.  

As my in-laws approach their eightieth year, the iMac is still running. It has never been back to ‘the shop’. They \[I\] have never had to deal with viruses, Trojans or other malware. I can’t imagine having the same happy story to tell had my wife bought her parents a cheap PC. 

But all good things come to an end, eventually. The iMac’s display has been hatching white lines for a few months now. When the in-laws visited today, they were set on buying a PC “for about £400 \[$600\]”. After I explained the pitfalls they would encounter – like learning a new OS and packing it up in its original box to take it for regular visits to ‘the shop’ – they were open to suggestions.

At $1300 (or £1149 after applying some currency-defying conversion rate), a new iMac is nearly three times their budget – out of the question. So I suggested combining a [Mac Mini](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/) ($599 or, again, £499) with a non-Apple external display, such as a Samsung 23in LED monitor, available from [Amazon US](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C18YRSA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00C18YRSA&linkCode=as2&tag=wordius-20) ($175) or [Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00CDP6JBE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00CDP6JBE&linkCode=as2&tag=wordius-21) (£130) – 1.5x their budget, but within reach. Now there’s a happy pairing: Apple and Samsung working together for the greater good.

Later, after they’d left, I wondered whether it would be possible to stash their old iMac out of sight – a shame, I know – and run a cable from the Samsung monitor to the old iMac. Having checked the [specs on the G5 iMac](http://support.apple.com/kb/sp69), it looks possible, as both the iMac and the Samsung support VGA, via an adapter. 

That sounds like a solution to me. Only $175 for the Samsung display and about $30 for an adapter. I just have to track down the correct adapter. Wish me luck, it’s a bore zone in the adapter search pages of Amazon.
