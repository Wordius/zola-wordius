Anyone who watches/reads the news will be aware that antibiotics are having a hard time of it. They’re not as effective as they once used to be. In fact, in an increasing number of cases they’re not effective at all. Then I came across a couple of articles today that revealed a bigger picture.

Maryn McKenna’s Wired piece, [When we lose antibiotics, here’s everything else we’ll lose too](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/11/end-abx/), led me to the Food and Environment Reporting Network’s [Imagining the post-antibiotics future](https://medium.com/p/892b57499e77) post on Medium. (Enough links already – [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com) *Medium* if you’ve never visited before.) Both articles serve as a reminder of how small and insignificant the human race is in the great scheme of things. The world, and nature, will take their respective courses, no matter what we throw at them. And maybe the human race is not part of their great plan anyway, ripe to be wiped off the face of the earth like the dinosaurs.

For as long as I can remember, doctors have been reluctant to dispense antibiotics. Lately, though, the message has struck home. My mum – 78 years old, blind, several strokes under her belt, but otherwise fit – has come down with a few bugs recently. Her doctor’s advice, go home, rest, drink plenty of water. She’s fine now. Her doctor was right, she didn’t need antibiotics to rid her of those ailments. But she *expected* to be prescribed antibiotics and, it occurred to me, doctors’ reluctance to dispense antibiotics appears to have reached a new, lower level. Let’s call it *base antibiotics*, because *peak* would infer something entirely different.

The subject of antibiotic failure fascinates me. I find it important, daunting and scary, which is why I’ve written this post rather than one about *another app*.

Read the articles I’ve linked to above. If they interest you enough, the fact that McKenna has also published a book on the subject, *Superbug: The Fatal Menace of MRSA*, available from Amazon ([US](http://amzn.to/HZOUWN), [UK](http://amzn.to/18Qk2Pm)), may also interest you. It’s on my to-read list. Even if I can’t change anything, I can at least know what to expect.
