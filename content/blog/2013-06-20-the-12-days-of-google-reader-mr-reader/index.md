Mr. Reader is the go-to app for catching up with my RSS feed subscriptions, and has been since September 2012. But ever since Google announced it was closing Reader back in March, I’ve been exploring other options. That has meant a lot of time spent in other apps and using a number of different feed-reading services. Happily, those days are numbered, and the uncertainty of the past few months will soon be a distant memory.

That’s why I was pleased to discover that Mr. Reader version 2.0 has been submitted to the App Store for review. It should be available as a free update to existing users or for purchase by new users early next week.

### Who’s behind Mr Reader?

That would be Berlin-based Oliver Fürniß, who develops apps for the iPhone, iPad and Mac. His shopfront is [Curious Times](http://www.curioustimes.de), where you’ll discover apps like Mr. Reader – actually, stay here for that – HappyDayz! and iOS-Simulator Cropper.

#### Interface

This review is based on my use of Mr. Reader version 1.11.2. I only gained access to the beta for version 2.0 last night – **Update:** Mr. Reader 2.0 is out of beta – which left me with too little time to give a full and considered opinion. Besides, it’s a beta, so not necessarily the end product. What I will say is that little has changed beyond the obvious – the syncing options. If you’re happy with Mr. Reader now, you will be just as happy when the upgrade is released.

I ran the beta by syncing to BazQux Reader. On the face of it, nothing has changed. Other than BazQux, Mr. Reader 2.0 will support Feedbin, FeedHQ, Feedly, Feed Wrangler and Fever out of the box. Google Reader remains an option till 1 July.

If you’re familiar with syncing multiple GR accounts with Mr. Reader, you’ll know that you can add and delete accounts from the accounts menu, accessible by tapping on your username (top left in the screenshot below). In Mr. Reader 2.0 the accounts menu is where you go to access the other services mentioned above.

The default view, below, shows feed folders in the sidebar, with the article table on the right. It’s possible to switch the order of the sidebar and article table in settings (gear icon, bottom left).

Tapping on a folder in the sidebar causes the article table to slide fully into view from the right. There are sharing, tagging and starring options on the right of each feed item.

Located at the bottom of the sidebar, the gear icon gives access to settings. This is where you adjust syncing options, the appearance of the articles table and articles (which can also be fine-tuned when viewing an article, below), and sounds. Services are covered in more detail below. ‘Miscellaneous’ allows you to change the way folders and feeds, and the subscriptions and articles table display. At the bottom, the Subscription Checker validates feed URLs; you might want to run this from time to time.

### The services menu

Mr. Reader’s services menu is one of the app’s best features. It allows you to choose exactly which services appear when you click the sharing icon in the article table and in article view. Each service can be dragged from ‘Not Shown in The Sharing Menu’ and dropped under ‘Shown in The Sharing Menu’. When you’re done dragging and dropping, click the right arrow next to each service to add your account details. In some cases, such as Evernote, you can also configure a template to determine what parts of a feed – title, URL, etc. – are included when you share with that service.

If the services you use are not included, I’d be surprised. The list is a long one (breathe in): email link, email article, copy URL, copy short URL, print, open in Safari, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Pinboard, Buffer, App.net, Bolt, Delicious, Diigo, Evernote, Instapaper, Kippt, LinkedIn, Message, Readability, Pocket, Send2Mac, SendTab, SendToReader, StockTwits (eh?), Tinderizer, Toodledo, Tumblr, Zootool. Breathe out.

Don’t be put off if you don’t see what you’re looking for. Below this long list of services is the ‘Add’ section, wherein you can build a service for a browser, a mail action or other apps. In ‘mail actions’, for example, you can configure templates for sending emails to other services. Evernote is provided as an example; all you have to do is add your secret Evernote email address. There’s [more about creating custom mail actions](http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/mail-actions/) in Mr. Reader’s support pages. I also recommend you read Federico Viticci’s ‘[Mr. Reader And The Services Menu for iOS](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/mr-reader-and-the-services-menu-for-ios/)’ on MacStories for a more detailed write up on URL schemes and mail actions.

### Article view

Mr. Reader offers some sophisticated – yet easy to use – controls for determining the look and feel (typography) of articles. Tap the capital `A` in the footer to adjust text alignment, measure (text width), leading (line-height), font, and font-size.

{{ image(path="gr-mr-reader-article-view-600-io.jpg", caption="Mr. Reader: Article view – adjust to suit") }}

Along the top of each article you’ll find a word count and a number of view options: RSS, Web, Instapaper, Readability and Pocket. RSS shows the full article or a summary, depending on the original feed’s settings. I prefer Pocket, as it grabs the full article, including any images. On the right, there’s a close button, which returns you to the article table.

You can navigate to the next or previous article in your feed by tapping the up/down arrows in the footer, or by dragging/pulling the current article up or down.

Recently, I stopped sending articles to read-it-later service [Pocket](http://getpocket.com); that’s how happy I am with Mr. Reader‘s article view. All articles I save to read later are now posted to Pinboard, whether I do that from within Mr. Reader or when I come across something interesting while in front of my Mac. The beauty of Pinboard is that you can subscribe to individual tags. So, back in Mr. Reader, I’ve subscribed to the ‘unread’ tag feed in Pinboard. What goes around comes around or, in my case, comes back. It also means I have one less app shouting ‘you have unread items’!

### Cost

Mr. Reader 2.0 will be a free update for existing users. If you haven’t already bought Mr. Reader, you can buy it now and enjoy the free upgrade when it becomes available. Mr Reader for iPad is priced at £2.49 ($3.99). 

### Conclusion

While the App Store has yet to approve Mr. Reader, it can only be a matter of time. The official blog suggests approval *should* be granted by early next week.

In compiling this review, I was conscious of the fact that I like Mr. Reader – a lot. In fact, there is nothing I don’t like. If I had one complaint, it’s that there’s no iPhone app. That said, I rarely use my iPhone to read my RSS feed subscriptions and I’m confident there will be an iPhone app from another vendor that will sync with the same feed-reading service I adopt in Mr. Reader.

Let me sign off by saying that Mr. Reader is great value for money. Consider this. Back in September 2012 I sent a secure payment to the App Store for £2.49. Minutes later I had Mr. Reader downloaded, set up on my iPad, syncing with Google Reader, and bringing me *the news* I want to read and in a format that’s agreeable to both my tastes and my eyes (article view is infinitely adjustable to suit your needs). Mr. Reader has been doing that virtually every night since, usually for a couple of hours a night. Now, I don’t watch much TV, but when I rent a newish movie from iTunes via my Apple TV, it costs £3.49 ($5.20); that’s £3.49 for a single night’s entertainment and I can only call it entertainment if I don’t pick a dud. My wife tells me I pick a lot of duds. You pay more, you get less. Go. Figure.

### Other RSS news

*   [Feedly’s](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/06/19/feedly-cloud/) cloud service is now live. That means your feeds are now being served by Feedly, not Google Reader.
*   Switzerland-based Christian Puricelli has completed development work on his feed-reader service [reader.is](http://reader.is). I haven’t tried it yet, so I can’t comment.

**Tomorrow:** Another feed-reading service – to be determined.

**Update:** Mr. Reader 2.0 is no longer in beta. The update is free to existing users.
