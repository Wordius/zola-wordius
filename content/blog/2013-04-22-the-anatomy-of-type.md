Stephen Coles’ *The Anatomy of Type* is also known as *The Geometry of Type* due to regional publisher requirements – two books, two titles, same content.

*The Anatomy of Type* has so far only made it as far as my wish list, which usually means a purchase is imminent. I’ll update this post with my personal notes at some point, but, for now, there’s a useful review over on [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/01/stephen_coles_the_anatomy_of_type_reviewed.html). Then, of course, there’s the publisher’s description:

> <em>The Anatomy of Type</em> explores one hundred traditional and modern typefaces in loving detail, with a full spread devoted to each entry. The full character set from each typeface is shown, and the best letters for identification are enlarged and annotated, revealing key features, anatomical details, and the finer, often-overlooked elements of type design. Containing in-depth information on everything from the designer and foundry, the year of release, and the different weights and styles available, <em>The Anatomy of Type</em> is more than a reference guide to the intricacies of typeface design. It is a visual send-up of some of the world’s most beloved typefaces, whimsically displayed in vibrant color.
