When I read Jonathan Poritsky’s review of [Ullysses III](http://www.ulyssesapp.com) on The Candler Blog last week, I thought here was a writing app that might finally better nvALT.

[nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) has been my note-taking app of choice for Mac for the past couple of years. But it’s missing one refinement – enhanced Markdown. A preview window is all well and good, but flitting between the naked source and a separate window showing the final output to gain a better understanding of a document’s structure is a distraction I can do without.

Many Mac writing apps already have enhanced Markdown built in, including Byword (App Store). Conversely, apps like Byword lack a lot of the features that make nvALT great, such as a document list, built-in tagging, and universal search. 

Ulysses III is the first app I’ve come across that appears to bridge this gap.

At $39.99 (£29.99), Ulysses III is above my spontaneous-purchase threshold. I’m not saying it’s expensive, just that I have to think twice before spending that kind of money. I have a dog to feed. So I waited for the demo. On Ulysses’ main site, you’ll find the demo link under the ‘Download on the Mac App Store’ button.

### Familiar look

Ulysses’ three-pane window is like looking at the Finder on steroids; it’s also similar to nvALT, with the one addition being the leftmost storage pane. The second pane contains the list of documents in the selected storage area and the third is the current document. I felt immediately at home.

Ulysses offers the ability to write in Markdown, Markdown XL (pumped) and Textile, and save in a number of formats, including plaintext, rich text, PDF, HTML, Markdown, Pages and Word. Ulysses III also offers an enhanced view of your Markdown, a feature I’ve been wishing for in nvALT since the day I started using it.

### Ulysses’ heel (yes, I know)

Here, I’m going to concentrate on a few sticking points. For a comprehensive review of Ulysses III’s features, see The [Candler Blog review](http://www.candlerblog.com/2013/04/09/ulysses-iii-review/) I mentioned earlier.

The first, and the only crucial sticking point for me, is in-app search. Currently, you can search within documents (sheets), but you can’t search your entire library unless you set up a filter. The filter approach might be useful in certain scenarios, but it presents a big problem for anyone with my ability to forget. The first thing I do every time I open nvALT, for instance, is type a word or phrase in the search bar to filter the list of documents and make it easier to find what I’m looking for. Fortunately, universal search is a feature Ulysses III’s developer says is on its way:

> @<a href="https://twitter.com/wordius">wordius</a> Search (CMD-F) is sheet-only. Library search is coming in 1.1, Filters *should* find all sheets with keywords already.

After playing with keywords (tags) and the option to set up filters, I can see the value in having a number of preset library-wide searches in the sidebar. But, if I’m honest, I would find limited use for them with full library search onboard.

Auto-pairing of brackets and quotes is a feature I’ve become accustomed to using in a number of apps. Whether it’s an important feature is another matter. Ulysses’ method for inserting links – CMD-L – without moving your hands from the keyboard feels like a better solution. Is auto-pairing a time-saving device or just a nice feature to have? I’d say the latter, because I always end up typing the closing bracket or quote to continue my train of thought.

My last concern is external to Ulysses’ set of features – Alfred workflows. [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) is a brilliant and free productivity app for Mac; it’s worth investing in the Powerpack (from £15) to extend the core features. I have a number of useful Alfred workflows for creating and adding to documents in nvALT. My hope is that I can reuse those workflows for Ulysses, with some basic editing.

Overall, though, my experience with Ulysses III is positive; make that very positive. I may or may not wait for 1.1 and the introduction of library search; either way, it’s unlikely my dog will go hungry.

Ulysses III is available from the Mac App Store.
