ReadKit started life as a read-later client for the Mac. When Google announced it was retiring Reader back in March, the team at Hungary-based Webin – the company behind ReadKit and a number of other Mac and iOS apps – set about extending its capabilities.

ReadKit 2.0, released on 30 May, is a full-featured RSS client. It supports Newsblur and Fever, as well as having its own built-in RSS reader (useful only if you don’t need a syncing capability). I asked the developer on Twitter whether there was any planned support for Feedbin or Feed Wrangler. The answer I got back was: “Feed Wrangler is on the way.” Over the weekend, I slipped in a few more questions, but I’ve yet to receive a response. I’ll add an update if I hear anything.

So, what’s ReadKit like?

### Interface

In a word: beautiful, clever, captures all your feeds, bookmarks and articles you’ve saved to read later in one place. Sorry, I said ‘a word’ then got carried away. But my point is that ReadKit’s beauty goes way deeper than the interface, below.

ReadKit’s leftmost pane shows smart folders, feeds (Newsblur, Fever, built-in), bookmarks (Pinboard, Delicious) and read-later services (Instapaper, Pocket, Readability). Sign in to individual services under `Preferences > Accounts` and they’ll show up here. The leftmost pane can also be toggled to show only folders (⌘–1) or only tags (⌘–2).

One of the most interesting aspects of ReadKit is smart folders, a feature that gives the user total control over content. Smart folders work a bit like ‘Rules’ in Mail.app. The image below shows a smart folder I created to collect all the articles I’ve favourited in Pocket.

One possible use of smart folders is collecting reference material for research. But I also foresee a problem, as smart folders appear to be indestructible. You could end up with a really long list of smart folders, some of which are temporary – only necessary for the duration of your research. (Poke me someone and tell me there’s a really simple way to delete smart folders.) One workaround is to repurpose smart folders when you no longer need them – double-click on a smart folder to edit the rules that govern its content.

To the right of the articles list, the article pane offers a nice, user-editable (see image, below) text-only view. If you prefer, control-clicking in the article list reveals a number of options, including ‘View in browser’, which refers to ReadKit’s built-in browser. You can also view the article in your default browser using shortcut key `B` or by clicking the browser icon in the top bar above the article.

I’d like to share one more image, one that’s possibly only relevant if you use Pinboard as a bookmarking service. When viewing archived bookmarks, click on the bookmark icon in the top bar to see any notes you might have added in Pinboard, below.

One other useful feature in ReadKit is *search*. Click on any folder, click the search icon below the article list and type a search query in the drop down to search *all* folders, not just the one you’ve selected. Search doesn’t work when you select a smart folder.

### Sharing

If I have any slight concerns about ReadKit, they’re to do with sharing. There isn’t an abundance of sharing options, email, iMessages, Twitter, Facebook and Evernote being the only ones available when in article view. For one, I’d like to see Pinboard. Yes I can fire off an email to my secret email address, but the ability to share direct to Pinboard – and use a keyboard shortcut – would be a much tidier solution.

ReadKit’s closest competition – at least, it will be if an update is forthcoming – Reeder for Mac offers a list of user-configurable sharing options long enough to fill a 27in Thunderbolt display (well, almost). Reeder is definitely the daddy when it comes to sharing.

### Conclusion

I liked and understood enough about ReadKit’s current and potential capabilities to buy the app. Neither of the available syncing services – Newsblur or Fever – appeals to me; not at the moment anyway. But knowing that syncing via Feed Wrangler and possibly others is in the works is reassuring.

While the limitations on sharing bother me, I’m willing to wager these will improve in time. Unfortunately, I was unable to get any clear direction from ReadKit’s developers in time for publication.

ReadKit is unlikely to change my reading habits – nightly consumption of feeds on my iPad – but it makes a great research tool for when I’m based at my Mac, combining, as it does, my bookmarks, feeds and read-later items into a single, accessible (eventually syncable) place.

ReadKit costs £2.99 ($4.99) from the App Store.
