Metaclassy has released Byword 2.0 to the masses. I dived straight in and paid the £2.99 ($4.99) in-app upgrade fee, forgetting that this blog is running under the static-file system delivered by [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com).

Not for long, though. I was already halfway towards restoring and redesigning this blog under WordPress when I read the Byword announcement. Work commitments mean completion is at least a week away.

So what’s the big deal with Byword 2.0? Publishing. You can now publish direct to WordPress, Tumblr, Evernote, Blogger, and Scriptogram on Mac and iOS . I’m looking forwarding to exploring the WordPress integration just as soon as this site is up and running back where it belongs.

Of course, there are plenty of other additions and refinements, all of which you can read in [Byword 2.0 gets publishing services, improved sync, and more](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/byword-2-0-gets-publishing-services-improved-sync-and-more/) on MacStories. It’s the most comprehensive review I’ve come across, and I’ve read quite a few today.
