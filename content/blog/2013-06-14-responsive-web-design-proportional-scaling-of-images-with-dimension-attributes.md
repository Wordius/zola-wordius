Roger Johansson, in [‘How to proportionally scale images that have dimension attributes’](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201306/how_to_proportionally_scale_images_that_have_dimension_attributes/):

> Allowing images to scale along with their container is an important part of responsive web design (and was so even before the term “responsive web design” existed). It’s really quite easy – all you need to do is give the image a width (or max-width) in percent.

Of course, there’s a bit more to it than that. But not much.
