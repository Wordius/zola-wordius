[Write for Mac](http://writeapp.net/mac/) is like nvALT with syntax highlighting. [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) has been my notes manager for four years, but I do most of my writing and editing in MultiMarkdown Composer 2 and Ulysses because both provide syntax highlighting, which makes both writing and editing that much easier. nvALT only offers a preview window, but when I want to locate a specific note, it’s my first port of call, because nvALT offers powerful ‘in-notes’ search, and its sidebar returns a listing of relevant notes.

But my reliance on nvALT may wane soon. So let me rephrase that opening sentence: Write *is* nvALT with syntax highlighting, a sidebar that shows your posts in date order, or your search results, and a nice UI. In short, it’s a great app in which to write as well as being useful for locating and managing notes. That said, after a few hours of testing, there are a number of bugs and irritations that need to be addressed:

* The app ‘hanged’ a few times – no work lost, but the hangs sometimes forced a relaunch. Even an action as simple as clicking on the ‘Share’ icon caused it to hang, albeit temporarily. Write will be updated, so I guess problems like this will be fixed in future releases.
* The disappearing scroll bar – Many apps hide the scroll bar when it’s not being used, but getting the scroll bar to appear in Write involves adjusting the window size, which, for me, means mousing. This wouldn’t be such a problem if I had a working Magic Mouse, but I’ve bought two in the past three years and both are broken – bad ‘Apples’. I’m currently using a base, wired mouse, that responds slowly to urgent shuffling, by which time the scroll bar has disappeared. 
* Substitutions – for example, ‘smart quotes’ – require an extra step compared with MultiMarkdown Composer.
* File extensions – Write takes the ‘either or’ route while nvALT allows you to select a bunch of acceptable extensions. In Write, the choices are txt (default), md, markdown, mdown and fountain. I prefer the nvALT approach, but this small criticism is not a deal breaker – pick a file extension, live with it.  
* Shortcut keys – I’d like to see a few more options added to the menus, like ‘Export’. Currently you have to mouse to the sharing icon and choose the type of export file you want – rtf, html, etc. Keyboard shortcuts are important, because keyboarding is quicker and more productive than mousing, regardless of whether you have a working Magic Mouse.

With a few of these issues ironed out, Write looks capable of reducing my reliance on Markdown editors to two – Write and Ulysses, the latter for my book work.

This was never intended to be a full-blown review of Write for Mac, only a quick response to discovering an app that looks like it could rock my world (in a purely first world sense). Maybe it will rock your world, too. Write for Mac has a whole bunch of features I will cover in a more in-depth review, including, but not limited to:

* compatibility with Mavericks tags;
* numerous sharing and export options, such as:
	* export as PDF, RTF, HTML;
	* email as: PDF, RTF, attachment, HTML, plain text;
	* Twitter, Facebook.
* a full-screen, distraction-free mode;
* theming, including a dark mode;
* auto-pairing for brackets;
* support for images.

Write for Mac is available from the App Store, currently priced at $9.99 (£6.99). I’ve yet to try it, but Write is also available for iPhone ($1.99/£1.49).
