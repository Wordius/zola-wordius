Everyone needs a side project. My wife’s decision to write about one of her passions in life, dogs, in turn created a side project for me – building her a site.

I’ve made a start and put up a <a href="http://shakepaws.com">landing page</a>, but it looks like most of the work will take place during the coming holiday period.

For the site proper, I’m using WordPress and ZURB’s brilliant <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> framework. Foundation is a mobile first, responsive front-end framework. Building sites isn’t my forte, never mind responsive ones. Foundation promises to ease the pain.

There are a couple of other tools I’ll be using to speed things along. First, there’s Panic’s magnificent <a href="https://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda 2</a>, which keeps everything nice and tidy by having all your files accessible through a single interface as well as providing an editor, access to Terminal and the ability to connect to your live site via FTP. Coda 2 is available from the App Store.

The other tool is <a href="http://thesassway.com">Sass</a>, a stylesheet language and CSS preprocessor that makes compiling CSS quicker and smarter through the use of variables and Mixins. If you’ve never used Sass before, I highly recommend you give it a try. ZURB’s Foundation framework integrates numerous <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html">Sass features</a>. 

I’ll write about how this ‘little’ side project went in a future post. In the meantime, if you like dogs, we hope you’ll like the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shakepaw">Shake Paws Facebook page</a> too.
