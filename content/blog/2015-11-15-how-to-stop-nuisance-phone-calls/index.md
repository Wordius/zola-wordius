As someone who works from home, I know all too well how many nuisance calls we receive throughout the day. A couple of Fridays ago, I counted seven. Aside from the pure annoyance factor, these calls waste time I could be spending on important projects. So, when it came time to replace the house phone, I chose with care.

Clearly, I am not alone. According to [a survey by consumer interest group Which?](http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/news/nuisance-calls-which-calling-time/), conducted in 2013, of 2000 people surveyed some 85% had received an unsolicited call in the past month.

Following more than 175,000 complaints to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in 2014, the government changed the law against cold callers earlier this year. Effectively, the change in the law has left it up to the ICO to assess when a company has made a serious contravention.  

All that appears to have made no difference to the number of nuisance calls I receive every day. But the phone I bought – BT’s BT8500 – has. The BT8500 comes with a feature called Guardian. When I receive a call from a number that is *not* in my contacts’ book, the caller hears a message along the lines of: “This phone number is protected by Guardian. Please leave your name after the tone and press hash.” Up to this point, my phone has not rung.

When it eventually does ring, it announces that ‘so and so’ is calling. I can then choose to accept (1), block (3) or send the call to my answerphone (4). Two weeks in, none of the spammers have chosen to leave their names. Result.

There are a couple of provisos: you must have ‘caller display’ enabled with your phone service provider and will have to add important phone numbers – family, friends, etc. – that you do not want to be greeted by the Guardian message so that they get straight through to you or your answerphone.

For me, that is a small price to pay. My broadband and phone provider, [Plusnet](http://www.plus.net/myreferrals/new.html?intReferrerID=00487437 "Plusnet for broadband and phone calls") – owned by BT, I should add – charges £0.99 a month for the caller display service, and it took me all of 20 minutes to add those important numbers.

The BT8500 Advanced Call Blocker phone and answering machine (twin handset pack) is available from [amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00LZTHUEO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00LZTHUEO&linkCode=as2&tag=since1964-21), priced at £48 at the time of writing. The BT8500 is also available with one, three or four handsets.
