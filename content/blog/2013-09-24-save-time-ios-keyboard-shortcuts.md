The recent avalanche of news, reviews and opinion surrounding Apple’s latest mobile operating system, iOS 7, reminded me of one of my favourite tricks – iOS keyboard shortcuts. It’s also one that’s not confined to this version of the operating system. This trick also works in earlier versions.

First, find iOS’s keyboard shortcuts under **Settings > General > Keyboard > Shortcuts**. Choose a word or phrase you’d like to include with a shortcut, add it as the *Phrase* then add your *Shortcut*.

I find this feature especially useful for contractions, with their pesky apostrophes, and to avoid having to type out email addresses in full, especially when signing in to various online accounts. These are the shortcuts I find most useful. 

 Shortcut  | Phrase    
  :------- | :------   
 cpy       | ©       
 ddnt      | didn’t    
 dnt       | don’t     
 epe      | info@personal.com (my personal email address)   
 ebl       | info@blog.com (my blog email address)   
 ewo     | info@work.com (my work email address)   
 il        | I’ll      
 im        | I’m       
 int       | isn’t     
 wnt       | won’t    
 wr        | we’re     

Bear in mind that the keyboard shortcuts are only activated when followed by a space or punctuation. Hence, the *il* shortcut for *I’ll* won’t activate if you intend to type *ill*, for example.

Of course, the real trick is remembering to use them.
