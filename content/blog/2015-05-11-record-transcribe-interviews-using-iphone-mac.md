When Twitter friend [Carolyn Wood](http://twitter.com/carywood "Carolyn Wood") asked a question about transcription software for the Mac – specifically Lion compatible – I was quick to respond, too quick, as it turns out. My first suggestion was to try [Audio Hijack Pro](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/ "Audio Hijack Pro") by Rogue Amoeba, served up by a fading memory. But from what I recall that is not the way to go, not my way, anyway.

The system I have in place came about when I took on a newspaper editorship. I fully expected to be conducting a lot of interviews in the field. In my first four months at the helm that hasn’t happened and I worked out the system more than six months ago, having followed numerous dead ends – hence the brain fade. What you will find below is not a full instructional as time doesn’t allow, but I hope you find it useful. Let’s start with the Mac end of the arrangement.

### Recording and transcribing audio on the Mac

The first thing to note is that I am running Yosemite (10.10.3) and I don’t know if the software mentioned below is backwards compatible. Download and install the following:

* [Audacity](http://web.audacityteam.org "Audacity recording and editing software"), a free app for recording and editing sounds on Macs.
* [Soundflower](http://soundflower.en.softonic.com/mac/download "A MacOS system extension that allows applications to pass audio to other applications"), a free Mac OS system extension that allows applications to pass audio to other applications.
* Pages for Mac ($19.99), free if you bought your Mac recently, otherwise you will have to buy it from the App Store. MS Word might be a viable alternative – worth trying if you already have it.

Open `System Preferences > Dictation & Speech` and select the `Dictation` tab. Toggle the button under the microphone icon and select `Soundflower (2ch)`. Make sure dictation is turned on and `Use Enhanced Dictation` is checked. Make a mental note of your shortcut key. Mine is set to `Press Right Command Key Twice`.

Launch Audacity and open a blank Pages document, and place the windows close together, reason being that you have to play your recording in Audacity then quickly switch to Pages and turn on the microphone. For this reason, I recommend pausing for a few seconds when making your original recording. In Audacity, set the four toggles to read: Core Audio, Soundflower (2ch), Built-in Input and 2 (Stereo) Recording Channels.

For the purposes of testing, I downloaded a copy of John F Kennedy’s [Berlin Address](http://www.freeinfosociety.com/media.php?id=150 "John F Kennedy’s Berlin Address").

### But I simply want to dictate to my Mac

If that’s the case, then the solution is much simpler. Plug a microphone into your Mac’s headphones port. Open `System Preferences > Dictation & Speech` and select the `Dictation` tab. Toggle the button under the microphone icon and select `External Microphone`. Again, make sure dictation is turned on and `Use Enhanced Dictation` is checked. Open Pages and type your dictation shortcut key. Speak into the mic and watch the magic happen as your words are transcribed into the Pages document.

### Recording audio on an iPhone

My iPhone 4S is still serving me well, so you don’t need the latest and greatest for this to work. Here’s what you do need:

* A good microphone. I bought Rode’s Smartlav+ lavalier microphone, available from Amazon.com ([$71.99](http://amzn.to/1PdrTAS "Rode Smartlav+ Lavalier microphone")) or Amazon.co.uk ([£44.99](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00EO4A7L0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00EO4A7L0&linkCode=as2&tag=wordius-21&linkId=WTUYSV3LMRRSKBD5 "Rode Smartlav+ Lavalier microphone")).
* Recording software. Rode has a [free app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/r-de-rec-le/id590021166?mt=8&uo=6&at=11l4We&ct= "Rode Rec Le"), upgradeable via in-app purchases (untested), but I use ALON Dictaphone ([App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dictaphone-voice-dictation/id595361888?mt=8&uo=6&at=11l4We&ct= "ALON Dictaphone"), $4.99) instead.

ALON Dictaphone offers the ability to save to Evernote, [Dropbox](http://db.tt/jw9tyCz "Dropbox"), Box, [Copy](http://db.tt/jw9tyCz "Copy online storage") and a number of other services and apps.
