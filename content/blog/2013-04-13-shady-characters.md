In 2010, when Keith Houston created his [Shady Characters](http://www.shadycharacters.co.uk) blog, a site that shines light on the history of typographic marks, such as the pilcrow, the ampersand and the hash mark, it probably wasn’t clear that all roads would lead to here, the publication of his site’s eponymous book.

*Shady Characters* is scheduled to be released in October 2013. For now, you’ll have to make do with the publisher’s description:

> Every day we rely on punctuation marks to help us say what we mean, but where did they come from? Consider the ampersand (&), which started life as Pompeian graffiti, or the at sign (@), which languished in obscurity for centuries until rescued by the Internet. These and a host of other intriguing marks populate Keith Houston’s rollicking and richly illustrated Shady Characters. From the Library of Alexandria to the halls of Bell Labs—across time, alphabets, and countries—readers will meet figures as diverse as Charlemagne, Vladimir Nabokov, and George W. Bush as they learn about marks as obscure as the interrobang, as omnipresent as the hashtag (#), and as divisive as the dash (—). Whether investigating what the pilcrow (¶) has to do with medieval Christianity or what became of many ill-fated attempts to produce a standard sarcasm mark, Shady Characters provides a charming and indispensable perspective on two thousand years of the written word.
