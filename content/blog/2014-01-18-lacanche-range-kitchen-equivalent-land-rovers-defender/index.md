There are many things to be grateful in the modern era, but the throwaway society, the one we’re living in right now, isn’t one of them. A lot of things are built *not* to last, which is the same as saying they are built to be thrown away or, possibly, recycled long before they should be.

A couple of years ago, a spring failed on one of my car’s wing mirrors. As a result the wing mirror flapped about as I drove along. The main dealer and an independent oily workshop told me the same thing: the entire unit would have to be replaced at a cost of £90, not just the 10p spring. I was soon going to trade in the car anyway, so I gaffa taped it and made do. 

When my wife and I moved to our current home 12 years ago, one of the extras we bought from the previous owner was a Lacanche range. As you can see, it’s a beast, solid as in Land Rover Defender solid. We paid £600. I still think that was money well spent. A similar version of our old Lacanche range costs £6000, new. 

A couple of years ago, though, around the same time as my car’s wing mirror was flapping around in the wind, one of the hinges on the Lacanche’s oven door failed. When I say it failed, I mean it started to fail. The first time I fixed it with a hammer. Instead of analysing the problem and coming up with a logical, intelligent solution, I resorted to brute force. The fix only worked for a time. On occasion, over the next two years I resorted to brute force again. Then, a couple of days ago, the failing oven door hinge’s arm, which should glide back into a slot in the frame surrounding the oven door, decided it wouldn’t – a result of one too many hammer blows, I suspect. Then it snapped.

I phoned [Fourneaux de France](http://www.fdef.co.uk), the UK distributor of Lacanche ranges. They told me I’d need the hinge and spring assembly and a hinge roller, cost £45.53 plus £3 P&P. 

The parts arrived the next day. I dug out the only tool I needed to replace old with new, a screwdriver. There were no instructions, but the simple, well-considered construction of the Lacanche range meant none were necessary. A little under an hour later, I had the oven door ‘gliding’ closed again. It’s like new.

They say the Land Rover Defender is popular in Africa because you can fix it with a screwdriver, an adjustable spanner and a pair of tights. Lacanche ranges should go down well.
