Keith Houston, of the [Shady Characters](http://www.shadycharacters.co.uk/) blog, says farewell to 2012 with another link-littered post full of punctuative goodness. Miscellany <sup>№</sup>21 includes reference to Ralf Hermann’s [Typographic Myth Busting: What’s a Ligature](http://opentype.info/blog/2012/11/20/whats-a-ligature/), Anyway?:

> Ligatures – simply put, two or more letters rendered as a single combined character, though Ralf can educate you further on the finer points of the definition – are one of those typographic flourishes that bring the page to life, and yet are often so subtle as to be virtually undetectable.

Merry Christmas.
