> What 1Password offers is greater convenience. Since 1Password already runs securely on Mac and iOS devices, you can have access to your 2FA codes on any of your Mac and iOS devices without having to mess around with Bluetooth (which means that it will work on any Mac, even ones without Bluetooth 4.0) [referring to issues with Authy]. You can copy/paste right from the app so you don’t have to manually type them (which was never particularly difficult, but was error-prone due to the time-limit factor of 2FA codes). For me, it also means that I can delete an entire app from my iOS device home screen, since I no longer need either Authy or Google Authenticator, I can just use 1Password

TJ Luoma goes on to explain in detail how to set up 1Password as your go-to app for two-factor authentication. For Evernote users wishing to set up 1Password in this way, it is worth noting that Evernote’s instructions *stipulate* Google Authenticator. Ignore that. Scan the QR code Evernote presents using [1Password for Mac’s](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id443987910?mt=12&uo=4&at=11l4We) built-in camera, save your Evernote login, and use the six-digit code provided by 1Password.
