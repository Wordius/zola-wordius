Finally, I have version control in operation for a number of my sites, thanks in no small part to Lucy Beer:

> \[A\]t its most basic, version control is a system that tracks all the changes you make to your files. This is helpful even for solo developers for a variety of reasons. It provides a complete log of all your changes so that you can hunt for bugs easier, revert changes, and, if you revisit a project a few months down the line, it’ll be easier to pick up where you left off because you documented your own thought process.

I had two of my sites under version control using Bitbucket and SourceTree – the free Mac app Lucy recommends – in under an hour.
