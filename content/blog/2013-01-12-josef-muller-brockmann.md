In another great guest piece on the <a href="http://ilovetypography.com" title="I Love Typography" target="_blank">I Love Typography</a> blog, Joanne Meister, owner and creative director of Oregon-based designmeister, recounts a chance tutelage under eminent Swiss graphic designer Josef Müller-Brockmann:

> I still remember [his business] card clearly. It was on light gray paper stock printed with a solitary color of cool gray ink. All content was in a singular sans serif face, all lowercase, and no punctuation to speak of other than the umlaut and hyphen in his distinguished name. No commas, no periods, no colons.

The article uses the catalogue, *[Josef Müller-Brockmann. Posters, 1948–1981](http://www.abebooks.co.uk/Josef-Muller-Brockmann-Posters-1948-1981-Josef-Pro/8849742793/bd)* to describe JMB’s move towards design based on objective criteria:
