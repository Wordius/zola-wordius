You should always listen to your mum. When I was in my 20s and leaving my parents home for the last time, my mum told me that I should invest in the best set of pans I could afford. (Of course, she said other, more important, things. This was only one of her nuggets of wisdom.)

She got the message across by telling me about her friend Susan and her husband Dave. Both Susan and Dave worked hard. They had low-paying jobs, but Susan in particular was good with money. They saved what little they could and invested their savings in unit trusts whenever they saw an opportunity. Another thing Susan invested in was a good set of pans. She bought them on hire purchase and paid off the credit as quickly as she could. Forty years later, Susan is still using the same set of pans. The couple’s attitude to money means they also own two houses outright, one of which is rented out to top-up their pension income.

Unfortunately, I didn’t take mum’s message on board immediately and subsequently owned a series of second-rate pan sets that never stayed the test of time, and use. 

That changed 12 years ago. I spotted a set of Anolon pans in a sale and promptly splashed the cash. The Anolon range has changed somewhat over the years, but the ones I bought are similar to those in the Raymond Blanc by Anolon cookware set (available from [Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003P4EKB8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B003P4EKB8&linkCode=as2&tag=wordius-21)) and exactly the same as the Anolon Professional hard anodised nonstick 12-piece cookware set available from [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006910G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00006910G&linkCode=as2&tag=wordius-20), pictured above.

I love cooking with them. What’s more, they look as good today as the day I bought them. They’re ovenproof, dishwasher safe – although I’ve always hand washed mine – and very sturdy. They also look good, which is why we have them hanging on hooks in the kitchen instead of tucked away in a cupboard.

Do yourself a favour: listen to your mum.
