In [How I Made a 26-Hour Day](http://andrewdumont.me/how-i-made-a-26-hour-day/), on Svbtle, Andrew Dumont describes how rearranging his day led to significant productivity improvements:

> Wait a minute, didn’t I just wake up two hours earlier? Well, yes. But I optimized my day, significantly. Along with waking up earlier, I segmented out the thing that caused the greatest distraction, emails and calls. By waking up a few hours earlier and creating more granularity, I avoided the krypotonite of productivity – context switching.

I already get up at 5am most days; maybe I should look more closely at how my day breaks down.
