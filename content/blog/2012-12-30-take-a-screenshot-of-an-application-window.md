There are countless apps for taking screenshots on a Mac. So many, that it’s easy to forget this facility is baked in to OS X. I was reminded of this when I wanted a screenshot of a specific application window. Should I launch [Skitch](http://evernote.com/skitch/ "Skitch website") and delve into its complex array of options, or was there a better way?

There is a better a way, and you don’t have to launch anything. Grab includes the following handy quick-key combinations:

* Fullscreen shot: ⌘⇧3
* Selected area shot: ⌘⇧4
* Specific window shot: ⌘⇧4 + Space
