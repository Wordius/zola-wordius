Editorial for iPad, a Markdown editor, enhances the writing experience and empowers the Markdown writer. The rest, its productivity-enhancing features and workflows, would be for nothing if it wasn’t first a great app, probably the best app, for writing in Markdown on an iPad.

The review. Well, there isn’t one, not here anyway. Perhaps I’ll write one when I’ve had time to get beyond kicking the tyres. Instead, check out Federico Viticci’s [Reinventing iOS automation: Editorial review](http://www.macstories.net/linked/editorial-for-ipad/) on MacStories, which I believe marks out Editorial as the Swiss Army Knife of iPad writing tools. Early on, Viticci says: “Editorial makes me *want to* work from my iPad.”

That’s exactly how I felt without even plumbing the depths of the app’s powerful workflows feature. I would quite happily plant a keyboard in front of my iPad for the sole purpose of using Editorial. It works with Dropbox, which is the only encouragement I need to merge Editorial into my current workflow.

Viticci’s review of Editorial extends to 24K words and comes complete with its own contents. Maybe that’s why he also published it as an iBook, *Writing On The iPad: Text Automation with Editorial*.
