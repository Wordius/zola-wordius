You can’t help but love the Yorkshire pudding, a welcome addition to any roast dinner.

I like my Yorkshire puddings big, and slightly crispy. The overall texture, though, should be quite soft. This recipe makes eight large Yorkshire puddings. When I say large, they’re about 10cm (4in) across. I use two four-hole Yorkshire pudding trays, similar to the Master Class non-stick four-hole Yorkshire pudding pan, available from [Amazon.com](http://amzn.to/Knuach) and [Amazon.co.uk](http://amzn.to/LfLwbP).

Usually, I’m just cooking for me and my wife, so when I make a batch of eight Yorkies, I separate them into twos and bag and freeze six of them. 

### Ingredients

* 125g of plain flour
* pinch of salt
* 3 medium eggs
* Half a pint of milk
* Olive oil
* **Serves: 8**

Occasionally, I halve this recipe, but use two eggs.

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 200C (390F).
2. Drizzle a little olive oil into each of the holes in the Yorkshire pudding trays. A teaspoon is more than enough.
3. Put the trays in the oven to heat the oil for 10mins.
4. Sieve the flour and salt into a mixing bowl, break in three eggs and start to combine the eggs and flour using a whisk. Gradually add the milk, whisking up the mixture to a lovely smooth, lump-free batter.
5. Pour the Yorkshire pudding batter into a jug.
6. Pop on an oven glove and, in turn, fill each hole in your Yorkshire trays until they’re almost brimming. Return to the oven immediately.
7. Bake for 25mins, and be sure not to open the oven door before about 22mins or your puddings will flop!

Don’t feel like you have to time cooking your Yorkshires to coincide with everything else being ready to plate up. That’s what I call putting pressure on yourself! Cook ahead or pop the Yorkshires in while your meat is roasting, remove when ready. Put them back in the oven for 5mins while you’re plating up.
