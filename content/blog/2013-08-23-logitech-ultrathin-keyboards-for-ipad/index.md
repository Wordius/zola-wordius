There are numerous occasions when carting my laptop around feels like overkill; more often than not, the iPhone doesn’t cut it either, especially when the writing task involves more than tapping out a reminder or an extended note to self. The more I write, the more numerous those occasions have become.

On its own, the iPad’s closely spaced touchscreen keys don’t give my fingers the space they need to peck. That’s why I’ve been looking for a keyboard to fill this not inconsiderable void. And I’m not alone.

Plenty of others have experimented with iOS-only solutions, especially when travelling. Earlier this year, Mike Vardy left his MacBook Air at home and took to the road with iPad and iPhone. In his posts – [iOS only](http://productivityist.com/blog/ios-only) and [On going iOS only](http://productivityist.com/blog/on-going-ios-only) – he doesn’t mention whether his iPad had a keyboard attached. It would have been a worthwhile addition if he didn’t.

After reading numerous reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that Logitech’s Ultrathin keyboard range offers the right balance between price, weight and protection for my iPad 2. Doubling as an aluminium cover for the screen, it attaches to the iPad via a magnetic clip. To use, gently tug apart iPad and cover, then insert the iPad into the slot that runs above the keyboard.

The Logitech Ultrathin keyboard for iPad versions 2 and 3 is available from [Amazon](http://amzn.to/19OF86u) ([UK](http://amzn.to/16Vg8Zc)). Logitech’s Ultrathin range also includes a keyboard for the [iPad Mini](http://amzn.to/178wiN0) ([UK](http://amzn.to/12vJutQ)).

I’m looking forward to this little experiment, more so because, unlike Vardy, I don’t own a MacBook Air. My 2011 Macbook Pro is considerably heavier.
