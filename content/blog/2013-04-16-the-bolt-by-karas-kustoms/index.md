If you appreciate fine objects, then you’ll likely find space in your pocket for The Bolt. Made by Arizona-based machine shop Karas Kustoms, The Bolt is a machined, bolt-action pen body.

Don’t be put off by the unique nature of the design. The Bolt is sized to take any Parker ballpoint compatible refill, including that used in the Fisher Space Pen.

According to Karas Kustoms, The Bolt is extremely durable and “may be the last pen you ever have to buy”. The pen body is machined from 6061-T6 aluminium – okay, aluminum, if you prefer – and fitted with a stainless clip and other hardware.

Available in blue, green, grey (pictured), orange, red, violet and black from [Karas Kustoms](http://karaskustoms.com/pens/the-bolt.html). Best have an ink refill (not included) at the ready.
