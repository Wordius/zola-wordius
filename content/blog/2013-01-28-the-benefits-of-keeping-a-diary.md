Brain Pickings editor Maria Popova serves up more ‘interestingness’ in [Virginia Woolf on the Creative Benefits of Keeping a Diary](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/01/25/virginia-woolf-on-keeping-a-diary/).

> [M]y belief that the habit of writing thus for my own eye only is good practice. It loosens the ligaments. Never mind the misses and the stumbles. Going at such a pace as I do I must make the most direct and instant shots at my object, and thus have to lay hands on words, choose them and shoot them with no more pause than is needed to put my pen in the ink.

Woolf’s legacy included ‘26 volumes written in her own hand’. I returned to keeping a diary last year, substituting electronic means for pen and ink.
