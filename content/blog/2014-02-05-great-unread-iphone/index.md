I thought I could resist the urge to buy yet another RSS app. I couldn’t. There has been a lot of hype around in recent days about Unread, a new RSS reader for the iPhone. I gave the increasingly isolated and underused Reeder (App Store) one last look two days ago, then opened up the App Store. 

In fact, hype is probably the wrong word to use. After playing with Unread on and off for forty-eight hours, I’ve come to the conclusion that Unread and its creator, Jared Sinclair, deserve all the praise they’ve been getting. 

I haven’t had the benefit like most of the reviewers I’ve read of being ‘beta’d up’. So, I’ve given Unread as thorough a test as I could manage in the short space of time I’ve been using it.

Buying Unread from the App Store also got me to thinking about my obsession with apps. Prior to the App Store’s launch in 2008, apps were infrequent purchases. The only app(s) I had to upgrade regularly – roughly every two years – was Adobe’s Creative Suite, and that felt like a bank raid, $1000 gone in the blink of an eye. How times have changed. The biannual bank raid will become a monthly drain on my income when I upgrade to Adobe CC, joining the existing weekly pickpocket service provided by the App Store.

Now, this is more than a simple review of Unread. Last summer, I published a series of posts under the banner [The 12 Days of Google Reader](/tags/12-days-of-google-reader/). The series ended without me capping it off with an overview of my RSS set-up. More on that later, but the point is that the launch of Unread has enabled me to put the finishing touch to that set-up. And now it’s time to explain why.

What’s immediately apparent when you launch Unread is the quality of the interface, from the simple, uncluttered screen – notice the lack of menu bars top or bottom – to the beautifully configured typography. All the usual menu bar stuff is hidden behind a gesture. Swipe left when in article view to reveal the simple list of options:

* Mark unread
* Star
* View on web
* Share
* Change theme.

You can see this in the right-hand screenshot below. When you’ve finished, swipe right to return to article view and right again to return to feed view. At which point, you’ll notice the article you just read has turned grey – unless, of course, you selected ‘Mark unread’ while in the options view.

You get used to all the swiping pretty quickly, because, apart from scrolling through your feeds, the swipe gesture is used exclusively to navigate Unread’s different views.

Getting back to the simple list of article options. Tapping on share, reveals a long list of activities (see left-hand screenshot below), from simply copying the URL of the article to sharing it with a number of different services and opening it in Safari or 1Password’s built-in browser. My only gripe with Unread is that I can’t reorder that list to put the activities most important to me at the top. But it’s a small gripe. Unread does, however, allow you to pare back that list. Open settings and scroll down to ‘Visible activities’ to remove activities and services you don’t use (right-hand screenshot, below).

There’s also a whole range of options under settings for controlling how Unread behaves and looks, from whether an article is marked as read as soon as you open it, to alternative themes. There are only two themes by default. You can unlock others by playing songs in your iPhone’s music app that contain certain keywords just before you launch Unread. I recall ‘chicken’ being one of the keywords, but have to confess I haven’t tried to unlock any of the alternative themes. I’m quite happy with the defaults: ‘day’ and ‘night’.

One thing you have no control over in Unread is the typeface, and I’ll explain why that is a good thing now.

### Typography

I mentioned typography earlier, but didn’t expend upon that. Unread uses the [Whitney](http://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/overview/) type family, from Hoefler & Frere Jones. Some RSS readers give you alternatives, Unread doesn’t. Developer Jared Sinclair must have gone through a rigorous testing process – hum, hah, a bit like you do when you’re choosing a typeface for your website – and decided Whitney, and only Whitney, would do. I remember the creators of [IA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/) doing the same when they limited typeface choices to, well, nothing. IA Writer served up [Nitti](http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bold_monday/nitti_ot/), and only Nitti, and if you didn’t like it you used a different writing app. I liked it. In my view, both Sinclair and IA made the right decisions, despite my preference for writing in a code-like font, such as [Source Code](https://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html), and reading using a serif font, like Georgia. 

Sinclair’s choice, Whitney, is a sans-serif. Whitney has heaps of character in the same way Helvetica has heaps of history. Whitney was primarily designed for signage and distance-reading applications, but its open shapes and variety of weights and widths mean it is also suited to reading applications, such as Unread. Hold your phone at arm’s length and you’ll see what I mean. Now try doing the same with an application that uses Helvetica.

### Automation

One of my favourite things about Unread is that it has a URL scheme, which means it can be put to work with powerful apps like Drafts for iOS. 

Now, I have to confess that when it comes to automation, I do my bit, but my bit doesn’t amount to much. If you want to learn more about iOS automation, then go and read someone who has spent a vast amount of time researching the subject, [Federico Viticci](http://twitter.com/viticci).

That said, I did create a simple Dropbox action in Drafts that brings material for link posts into my workflow. It works like this. First, I select a block of text in article view in Unread, tap ‘Share’ when the contextual menu appears, then choose ‘Drafts’ from the list of options. Unread implements Drafts’ URL scheme from here, which launches Drafts and adds the block of text, site name and a link to the article it came from in a new note. To create my link post, all I have to do now is title the note and select my ‘save link post’ action, below. 

{{ image(path="unread-drafts-582.png", caption="Put Unread to work for you by combining it with a powerful app like Drafts") }}

To explain, the action sends the file to my ‘writer’ folder in Dropbox, names the file using my predefined scheme – I precede all draft posts with ‘DFT-’ and the ‘[[title]]’ adds the first line of the note to the filename – gives it a .txt extension and includes the content of the Drafts note in the body of the file. 

Unlike Viticci, I work almost exclusively from my Mac. The note will be nestled among my other drafts in Dropbox for when I get time to edit it. Alternatively, I could edit and publish it direct from [Byword for iOS](http://bywordapp.com), which has a useful publish to WordPress feature.

As I mentioned earlier, Unread has made my RSS set-up complete, so before I sign off, here’s a quick explanation of how that looks now.

### My RSS set-up

Last summer, when I published my [12 Days of Google Reader series](/tags/12-days-of-google-reader/), I never got around to summing up my set-up in the post-Google Reader world. One of the reasons was that I was never entirely happy with my lot on the iPhone. Unread has changed all that, so, finally, here’s a summary of the rest of my set-up:

* [Feedbin](https://feedbin.me) – a subscription costs $3/mo or $30/year.
* [ReadKit for Mac](http://readkitapp.com) – much more than an RSS reader, ReadKit offers an all-round reading experience on your Mac, providing access to [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) or Delicious bookmarks and saved articles in [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com), [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/a/) or [Readability](https://www.readability.com). ReadKit costs $6.99 from the Mac App Store.
* [Mr. Reader for iPad](http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/) – more often than not, I access my RSS feeds on my iPad and that means I use Mr. Reader a lot. Until Unread arrived for the iPhone, Mr. Reader had little in the way of competition. But the significant improvement in the iPhone reading experience may change that somewhat. Mr. Reader for iPad costs $3.99 from the App Store.

Unread is available from the App Store, currently priced at $2.99.
