Maryn McKenna, for [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/ebola-ic-research/):

> Infection prevention is a science of tiny details, all of them granular, almost none of them interesting to anyone outside the field. Granular means not just figuring out which protective equipment workers should wear in which situation — not as obvious as you would think, because the more you load them with gear, the more tired and distracted they become — but also determining the best ways to keep up their expertise in putting the equipment on and taking it off. It means designing room sinks so that bacteria don’t splash back out of the drain, and figuring out where to put shelves so nurses aren’t distracted on the way to the sink to wash their hands, and whether to focus on handwashing at all, or just encourage glove-wearing all the time.

There’s a thing. Weekly visits to my local butcher entail ordering cooked and raw meat. After fulfilling my raw meat order, the serving member of staff heads for the sink to wash their hands before taking my order of cooked meat. More often than not, forgetful me then asks for half-a-dozen sausages. Without fail, whoever is serving me goes back to the sink and washes their hands before handling the Lincolnshires. Every member of staff follows this routine.

Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for two local hospitals where I regularly take elderly relatives. Instead, many doctors, nurses and other medical staff routinely flout rules that say they should wash their hands between patients. Maybe they would rather be rebels than save lives.

In the case of Ebola and other serious diseases, hospital administrators have a duty of care to ensure their staff are appropriately equipped, well informed and have safe environments to operate in.
