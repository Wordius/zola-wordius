If the designers of ebook tools followed the lead of web designers instead of book designers, maybe ebook design wouldn’t be the mess it is today.

> In the days of scrolls, entire stories were contained in single continuous sheets of papyrus. But as I mentioned … they were unwieldy. Now that passages of content can traverse a fixed screen, with the befores and afters tucked neatly out of sight, scrolling makes sense again. Web designers have known this for a long time. And yet the designers of iBooks, Kindle, Nook et al chose to ignore this simple fact. Instead, they imposed a horizontal, page-based navigation that feels like looking through a keyhole, lacks aesthetic craftsmanship, and is useless for reference or research. We’ve been given the wrong tool for the job.

It’s time for a rethink.
