When Mailbox launched back in February, I joined the queue for access like so many others. It didn’t take as long as I’d expected, despite my place in the queue being some way north of 200,000.

Access granted, I launched the app and signed in to my Gmail account only to receive an error message indicating that I wasn’t set up for IMAP. At the time it felt like too much effort, plus I had this nagging notion that somehow, somewhere I would lose access to something *really* important. So I left my POP settings alone, closed Mailbox, and forgot about it.

### Major update

Then came the announcement last week that Mailbox had [added some new features](http://www.mailboxapp.com/blog/?p=1%23announcing-cloud-search-account-specific-signatures): cloud search of Gmail messages (those in your Gmail account, not on your iOS device), signatures per email account, and open links in Chrome. The guys at Mailbox had introduced many of the key features requested by early adopters, which convinced me to give it another try.

I updated the Mailbox app, headed for my Gmail account, disabled POP, enabled IMAP – you’ll find both under **Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP** – returned to Mailbox, signed in to Gmail, and I was up and running with a new iOS email client. All in all, it was a lot less effort than I’d first imagined.

Mailbox has taken me completely by surprise. It has a fresh, clean look and a simple take on email. Its goal is to get you to Inbox Zero in as few steps as possible. When new mail arrives, you have three options: Later, Inbox and Archive. Swipe right on a message to archive (a white tick on a green background appears as you swipe), long swipe right to delete (white cross on red), swipe left to mark a message for later (white clock icon on yellow). When you mark a message for later reading, it is removed from your inbox. The message returns to your inbox based on what you choose from Mailbox’s preset time intervals: Later Today, This Evening, Tomorrow, The Weekend, Next Week, In a Month, Someday, or pick a date in the future.

First, I set up Mailbox with my three main email addresses: Personal, Work and Blog. ‘Personal’ is my main Gmail account, the one I used to sign in to Mailbox. ‘Work’ and ‘Blog’ are not Gmail addresses. I added them as aliases in Gmail’s web interface (**Settings > Account > Send mail as**). Then, back in Mailbox, I added the ‘Work’ and ‘Blog’ addresses under **Settings > Email Accounts > (My Personal Gmail account) > Add Alias**; Mailbox requires the username (generally the email address itself) and password for each of your Gmail aliases at this point. Bear in mind that ‘Gmail aliases’, as in my case above, don’t have to be ‘Gmail’ addresses. They can be anything, such as **info@domain.com**.

Mailbox allows you to add signatures for each Gmail address, including different signatures for aliases. Once you’ve added a Gmail alias, go to **Settings > Signatures**. You have the option to use a single, default email signature or add custom signatures for your main Gmail account and each of the aliases. I prefer the latter approach, because it allows me to separate work from pleasure and assign information, such as Twitter usernames and website addresses, that are pertinent to my different email accounts.

It’s all very well having the ability to send from multiple email addresses, but how, exactly? When you start a new message in Mailbox, click the arrow icon on the right of the ‘To:’ field to reveal the rest of the send options. Tap on the ‘From:’ field, which will contain your default Gmail address, the one you used when signing in to Mailbox. Choose the email address you’d like to send a message from.

Another neat feature of Mailbox is lists. There are three default lists: To Buy, To Read and To Watch. It’s also possible to create custom lists to suit your needs. Add an inbox item to a list with a long swipe left (a white list icon on an orange background appears as you swipe). In Gmail, lists are stored under the Mailbox label. It’s also possible to delete lists in Mailbox, via **Settings > Lists**. Items stored in a deleted list are moved to your archive.

### Other stuff you should know

#### Doors to manual

If you’ve been using the native Mail app to receive email on your iOS device, you might want to give your battery a break and switch it to manual. Go to **Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Fetch new data – Off > Advanced > Manual**. This way you can still share via email in other apps, such as Safari.

#### Bonus Dropbox space

Connect your [Dropbox](http://db.tt/jw9tyCz) account to Mailbox **Settings > Dropbox** and the demon syncing and storage app will give you an extra 1GB of storage, gratis. The other very good reason for doing this is that you will be able to attach Dropbox documents to emails sent from Mailbox.

My time with Mailbox has been brief, but it’s addictive. So much so that I find myself launching Mailbox even when there’s nothing new to see. In truth, at this early stage, I’ve probably wasted as much time opening and closing Mailbox as I’ve saved using it’s simpler and vastly superior interface. In the weeks ahead I expect my condition will ease, and Mailbox will smooth its way into my workflow. All great apps have one thing in common: they *just work*. Mailbox works.

Install Mailbox for iOS from the App Store. It’s free.
