Reading Dr. Drang’s [‘The RSS reader search continues’](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/11/the-rss-reader-search-continues/), it struck me how we all have different priorities when deciding whether an app suits our needs.

Drang appeared to have found the perfect replacement for Reeder for iPhone, the app he wants to find an alternative for because it lacks integration with Safari’s Reading List. That app was NewsFeeds, which is free from the App Store. 

But NewsFeeds is missing one feature that didn’t meet Drang’s flow – in-article navigation to the next/previous article. Instead, Newsfeeds forces you to go back to the article list and take it from there. 

That, in a nutshell, is precisely how I use an RSS reader – I navigate back to the article list to chose the next item to read. Why? Well, when I’m scrolling through my ‘tech feeds’, for example, there are usually plenty of items that don’t interest me. The article list is the quickest way to scroll past those that don’t and find those that do interest me, assuming the headline writers have done a good job.

Think I’ll stick with Reeder on the iPhone. My flow doesn’t call for Safari Reading List integration although, it has to be said, it’s a bloomer of an omission on Reeder’s part.
