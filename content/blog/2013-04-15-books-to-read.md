I’ve fallen into this trap many a time. In the past, when I’d finished whatever book I’d been reading, I would start to figure out what to read next. This approach left an unsightly gap in my reading timeline; worse, I was missing out on one of my greatest pleasures. These days, I always have three or four books on my ‘to read’ shelf. Thanks to Dr Drang, I now have lists of potential future reading material for when it comes time to replenish that shelf:

Dr Drang has downloaded the <em>Guardian</em>’s lists and made them smartphone friendly – so even less work and more reading time.
