Last night when I tapped a link in [@MacDrifter’s](http://macdrifter.com/) RSS feed in Mr Reader (since closed) on my iPad, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Two hours later I’d read, and re-read, Tyler Reinhard’s Getting Things Done with Semantic Notes. Reinhard says:

> The first obvious change I needed to make was the process by which I take, process, refer to, review, and store notes. I needed something with a long lifespan, that requires little maintenance, and allows for an efficient weekly review. A system I can trust with my low-rent schemes, project-related brainstorms, and moments of epiphany. And, it has to prime those things for future use and next-actions.

I immediately wrote a few test notes, and it works – for the most part. The one stumbling block is my mobile note-taking app, Notesy. Dropbox issues forced me to quit Simplenote a few months ago. I replaced it with Notesy. But Notesy, annoyingly, strips spaces from the front of note titles, rendering a valuable part of this system useless. (Unprocessed scratch note titles are preceded by a space so they filter to the top when the list is displayed in descending alphabetical order.)

But Notesy is still a great notes app. It has the three key features I look for:

*   syncs with [Dropbox](http://db.tt/jw9tyCz) 
*   supports Markdown 
*   searches inside notes.

Many notes apps offer the first two features, but, as of this morning, few came to mind that offered the third. This afternoon, a comment from another reader of Reinhard’s post, Alan Schauer, pointed me at Nebulous Notes (for Dropbox). So I’ll give it a try.

Go and read Reinhard’s [Getting Things Done with Semantic Notes](http://semanot.es). Less than 24 hours after doing just that, I’m implementing a similar system. Spring (note) cleaning came early this year.
