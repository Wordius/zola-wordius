First, please humour me.

Eight years ago my mum was diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration ([AMD](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Macular-degeneration/Pages/Introduction.aspx)). She has dry macular, the untreatable type, and today only a glimmer of peripheral vision remains in her right eye.

Mum can still get around her house unaided, because she knows where everything is. Almost daily, she still gets around the town she lives in, because – most of the time – everything is where it was the day before.

Mum described the decline in her vision as like seeing the world through the holes in a colander. At first the holes were big. Over time they grew smaller. Eventually, there were no holes through which she could see the world. Her peripheral vision was all she had left. Then on Christmas morning 2011 she fell out of bed and banged her head on a bedside table. And with that the peripheral vision in her left eye – her “better eye” – was gone. Some Christmas present.

While it has been difficult for me to witness the decline in mum’s sight, I can only imagine how difficult it has been for her. The things she misses most are reading – a book, a newspaper – and seeing her grandchildren. But she’s resilient, and she makes the most of every day.

Mum is 78 years old. She never got into using computers or mobile devices. But after reading iOS developer Matt Gemmell’s 2010 post [Accessibility for iPhone and iPad apps](http://mattgemmell.com/2010/12/19/accessibility-for-iphone-and-ipad-apps/) this morning, I wish she had.

Matt has experienced the fear of losing his sight. It prompted him to experiment:

> When you first enable VoiceOver on a Mac, you’re asked if you’d like to take a brief tutorial; I did. After the first couple of minutes, I closed my eyes, and really used it. I wept.
> 
> These technologies are a lifeline for visually impaired users. Accessibility isn’t about providing simplified or alternative content, it’s about ensuring everyone has equal access to your existing content.

You don’t have to be an iOS app developer to take away something meaningful and useful from reading Matt’s article.
