This detailed tutorial from developer Aral Balkan (<a href="http://twitter.com/aral" target="_blank">@aral</a>) explains how to create a website, starting with a simple plain text file and ending with a site hosted on Amazon S3.

I’ve been trying my hand for a couple of years now, but I still find valuable lessons in tutorials such as Aral’s [Content Out Web](http://contentoutweb.com/lessons/1/). For one, using Amazon S3 to host a static site had never occurred to me.
