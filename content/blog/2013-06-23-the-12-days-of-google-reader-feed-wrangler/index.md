David Smith’s [Feed Wrangler](https://feedwrangler.net) has all your bases covered (assuming you’re a Mac user); it’s a feed-reading service with a web interface, and first-party iPad and iPhone apps. Even the Mac is covered, with support on its way from third-party app ReadKit, and a first-party app in the works from Feed Wrangler developer Smith. Feed Wrangler is another of the paid-only services – $18.99 per year – that will not receive full reviews here (not yet anyway). Instead, below you’ll find links to a number of reviews that I plan to use to help inform my final decision on a replacement for Google Reader. Those links:

* **Update:** [Feed Wrangler reviewed: Why I picked it](http://crateofpenguins.com) – new hands-on review by Sid O’Neill. 
* [Feed Wrangler (sic): The Feed Reader Designed Around Feeds](http://web.appstorm.net/reviews/media-reviews/the-feed-wranlger-the-feed-reader-designed-around-feeds/) – Appstorm (you’ll have to forgive them for the typo in the headline).

## The story so far

I’ve said time and again in this series that the web interface is not important to me from a reading perspective. But in Feed Wrangler’s case – and a number of other services – I can’t let design considerations pass without comment. I’ve yet to find a screenshot of FW’s web interface that shows it in a good light. Some services, such as Feedly’s, feel over-designed; FW is the opposite – it looks as if no thought has gone into the design at all. The same can’t be said for functionality. Smith has given a great deal of thought to how we use RSS and come up with a credible alternative to folders. But, for many, Google Reader was RSS. Reader was where they collected and consumed their feeds. I can’t see them wanting to do the same in Feed Wrangler.

I have to balance this with the knowledge that Google Reader did not exactly give developers much notice. Smith should be congratulated for creating a service that works. Not only has he built the backend, but he has put out a full suite of apps (almost). With Feed Wrangler, you pay for the feed-reading service; the iPad and iPhone apps are thrown in. Another thing in Feed Wrangler’s favour is that it’s proving popular with third-party app developers. If you don’t like the first-party apps, there’s plenty of support forthcoming from elsewhere. If you want Feed Wrangler to look after your subscriptions, the service charges $18.99 per year. Feed Wrangler’s iPad and iPhone apps are free. Fans of iPad app [Mr. Reader ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mr.-reader/id412874834?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l4We) should know that support for Feed Wrangler has been added in version 2.0, currently in review at the App Store.

**Tomorrow:** It’s Monday. Everyone knows that’s ReadKit for Mac day. It’s a looker.
