If you’ve ever found yourself scrabbling around looking for that elusive readme file and a reminder of how to insert images in Markdown, or the correct syntax for inserting interactive HTML5 content in your code, Cheaters is probably what you’ve been looking for all along.

Brett Terpstra, Cheaters’ creator, describes the system as: “a collection of HTML-based cheat sheets meant for display in an Automator-based popup browser which can float on your screen while you work in other apps”.

As of writing, the system comes pre-loaded with cheat sheets for HTML5, CSS3, Selectors, jQuery, Markdown, MMD, Gmail, Vim, Alfred and Git. If you know a bit of HTML, you can edit the existing cheat sheets and add more of your own making.
