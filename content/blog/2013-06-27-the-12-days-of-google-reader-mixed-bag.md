Today saw a number of announcements from app developers, including Reeder developer Silvio Rizzi, whose iPhone, iPad and Mac apps are among the most popular with RSS users.

News from Reeder might have been the most eagerly awaited, but it wasn’t the only news. 

But, first, an apology. My review of FeedHQ will not appear till tomorrow. My fault, as I was late getting questions out to the developer. The review and Bruno Renié’s responses will appear tomorrow.

Okay, back to Reeder.

### Reeder for iPhone

Reeder for iPhone is now free, and version 3.2, which currently supports Feedbin and Fever, will add Feedly and Feed Wrangler. Google Reader is no longer supported, which doesn’t surprise me in the least.

### Reeder for iPad

Rizzi indicated on Twitter that Reeder for iPad would support the same services as its namesake iPhone app, but also added it “still needs some work”.

### Reeder for Mac

Silence. I think it’s still free on the App Store if you fancy adding another useless heirloom to your collection.

### ReadKit

Mac app ReadKit now supports Feedbin and Feed Wrangler; it already had Newsblur and Fever signed up. 

### Digg (iPad and iPhone)

News service Digg’s iPhone and iPad apps will now take your Google Reader feeds off your hands for free. Clean and simple is all I have to say at the moment. The web interface is still in beta.

### Something in the works (in brief)

#### Feedbin

I paid my $2 – or thought I had till an invoice reading $0 arrived in my inbox – for a monthly subscription and took the plunge. Pretty to look at, but so frustratingly slow: make a cup of tea, walk the dog, come back later. Late today, though, Feedbin developer Ben Ubois announced there would be some downtime tomorrow while he transferred the database to new, faster servers. 

#### Feed Wrangler

Some Apple commentators have bet their house on this one – okay, a cheap night out. But, after a few hours toying and a long time spent using smart folders to create common-or-garden folders, because FW doesn’t have the decency to automate this process, I’m mystified as to why. User experience designers would have a field day. There is something that feels plain wrong about FW’s smart folders. If you want an example of smart folders done well, ReadKit, the Mac app I earlier this week, will give you a better idea.

Currently, Feedbin and Feed Wrangler leave me cold. I’m going to give it a couple of weeks – 12 days in the case of FW in case I have to get my money back – before doing full reviews; that should be long enough for Google Reader’s dust trail to settle.
