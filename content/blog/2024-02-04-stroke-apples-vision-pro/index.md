Having had a [stroke](/about/) a couple of years ago, I won’t be trying out Apple’s Vision Pro. I’ll leave that to all the trailblazers with deep pockets. For more about medical conditions and the Apple Vision Pro, see this [article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT213935).

I had envisioned it as being a bit like in the movie Minority Report, spatial computing rather than facial computing. But that appears to be far from the reality, as revealed in [The Apple Vision Pro is Spectacular and Sad](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/02/apple-vision-pro-headset-review/677347/), by Ian Bogost, writing for the Atlantic.

Stroke, specifically, is not mentioned in Apple’s article. But from what I’ve read around the web, I don’t want to risk having that feeling again.
