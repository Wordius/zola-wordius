Adobe’s InDesign has been at the centre of every print-related project I’ve produced since 2003. But it was only a few years ago that I discovered InDesign’s magnificent core could be extended through the addition of third-party scripts and plugins.

Alexander Charchar, of Smashing Magazine, has written a great post, [Useful InDesign scripts and plugins to speed up your work](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/16/indesign-scripts-and-plugins-to-speed-up-your-work/), that brings together many of the best, from working with text to graphics, PDFs and automation.

Check it out. I’m certain you’ll find something in there to make your life easier.
