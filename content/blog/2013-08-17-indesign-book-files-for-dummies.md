A printer called yesterday to request information about a book they’d just received. The printer was unaware that I was no longer contracted to produce books for the client in question.

They were confused as to why they had received the book piecemeal, a PDF per chapter, rather than the *normal way*, my way, as a single, sequentially numbered PDF. Of course, I had to tell the printer, politely, that they should raise the issue with their client, who was no longer my client.

So, the point. It appears my former client’s new supplier either is not aware of, or has no idea how to create, InDesign book files.

Don’t fall into the same trap. Creating an InDesign book file is easy and [Adobe’s support page](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/indesign/cs/using/WSa285fff53dea4f8617383751001ea8cb3f-6ccaa.html) contains everything you need to know.

Consider the benefits:

* You’ll save time.
* You’ll keep your client happy.
* You’ll gain the respect of your printer, maybe.

Best of all, your client will get what they’re paying you for. Don’t be a dummy.
