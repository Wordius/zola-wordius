When I left the UK for the French Alps last week, I went prepared: passports, EHIC cards, travel plugs… you name it … and maps – more maps than I imagine Alexander the Great used in his quest for world domination. I created and printed them from Google Maps, with directions; I had a European road map atlas – years out of date – tucked away under a rear seat just in case; I had my car’s built-in GPS system; and I had Google Maps on my iPhone. Anyone would think I had been a good scout; I wasn’t.

What was I thinking? This was no adventure into uncivilised territory. It involved driving down a series of interlinked motorways for 500 miles, after which time I would be within 17 miles of my destination. Maps should have been the least of my worries. At least some of the time I gave over to preparing maps would have been better spent packing the batteries I had charged to keep my camera running.

### Take the next right…

As we drove out of Calais, the printed directions were in my wife’s hands. The car’s built-in GPS had been programmed, but I had yet to switch it on. My daughter had my iPhone and was busy pecking destination ‘Flaine’ into the Google Maps app.

“Bear right in 1000ft,” came the instruction from what I thought was the car’s built-in navigation system, as the GPS map and a helpful directional pointer lit up the screen on the dashboard. The road signs agreed with the instruction, so I took the exit. Meanwhile, my wife ruffled through the sheets of directions I’d handily presented to her in reverse order.

When I checked the car’s nav settings, they still read ‘Start route guidance’. Then my daughter confirmed she had pressed start in Google Maps on my iPhone, which automatically pairs with the car’s Bluetooth system whenever it’s in range.

“At the roundabout…” chirped the American voice delivering Google Maps’ directions. I allowed the app to steer us for a short while before starting route guidance on the built-in nav system. The fact GPS-based apps tend to be thirsty for battery juice – and I didn’t have an in-car charger for my iPhone – was one reason for this choice. That I had no idea how GPS data affects a restricted mobile data plan, especially when roaming, was another.

### Google Maps just works

For the hell of it, I gave Google Maps a whirl on the return leg of our trip. Around Reims, in northern France, there’s a new stretch of motorway; it’s so new my eight-month-old car’s nav system suggested a U-turn would be the best course of action when we encountered it on our way south. Google Maps had no such problem. Again, on the return leg of our trip I kept usage to a minimum in the interests of battery life and a desire to keep my mobile bill for a week abroad within my pain threshold.

It seems my intuition about the GPS data was right. If you have a restricted mobile data plan, steer clear. On the other hand, if you’re one of the lucky few with unlimited data plans give Google Maps a workout on your next road trip. Just make sure your phone’s also plugged into a charger.
