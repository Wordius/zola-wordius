Hide the dock. It’s as simple as `⌥-⌘-D`, or point your mouse at ` > Dock > Turn hiding on/off`. I can hear the in-rush of air as you suck volumes of the stuff between your teeth, but bear with me.

Look at the clutter in my Dock in the image below; look at the distracting new-email announcement. I often found it impossible to ignore that little red blob atop my email client. Ten minutes, 20 minutes, or 30 minutes might go by, but sooner or later I would find myself staring at my inbox, disappointed to discover I’d been drawn there by someone pedalling yet another magical SEO service.

When I first hid the Dock, my main goal was to reclaim screen space. It wasn’t till a few days later when I noticed that this simple action had had unexpected productivity benefits. I’d often find I had ten emails when I wasn’t aware I’d received any – none of them life-or-death urgent, I should add. This prompted me to develop a routine for checking email. Instead of diving in every five minutes, I only check it first thing in the morning, once around lunchtime and again late in the afternoon. Outside working hours the gloves are off, though – there’s no hiding from my iPhone!

Back when I first made this magnificent discovery, hiding the Dock brought with it an urge to discover better ways to use my Mac.

### Anyone for a spot of keyboarding?

With OS X’s Dock out of sight, I took the next step on the productivity ladder by using my keyboard rather than my mouse to launch apps and locate files and folders. I could write a book on keyboarding – and I’ve no doubt someone probably already has – but to round off this post, let’s just consider one technique.

Spotlight is OS X’s built-in search application. It knows where everything is on your Mac, and it’s entire reason for being is to help you find what you’re looking for. Sadly, most of the people aren’t even aware of its existence, and many of those that do choose not to use it.

To launch Spotlight you could reach for your mouse and click the magnifying glass in the menu bar at the top right of your screen, but `⌘-space bar` then typing your query – the name of an app, file, or folder – is much quicker. Spotlight will do the rest, generating a list of the most relevant results. If Spotlight’s top result isn’t what you’re looking for, down-arrow to highlight the correct one then hit return.

Apple’s support site has a comprehensive list of [OS X keyboard shortcuts](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1343). It’s also worth bearing in mind that you can add your own shortcuts in `System Preferences > Keyboard`, under the ‘Keyboard Shortcuts’ tab.
