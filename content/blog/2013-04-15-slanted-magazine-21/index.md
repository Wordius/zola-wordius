Number 21 is the Cuban issue:

> Revolution or evolution? Rise or fall? House of pleasure or paradise? Coke or Guarapo? Marlboro or Cohiba? Beans or lobster? Freedom or Guantanamo? Track suit or tie? Internet or pigeon? Salsa or rap? Old Timer or Turbo? Museum or laboratory for the future? Working or not? Hope or exile? Or a mixture of everything? Cuba is different than we think – more complex, deep and full of surprises. Reason enough to devote the 21st edition of *Slanted* magazine to a generation of young Cuban artists and designers.
