Love this sign-off on blogger David Sparks’ (@MacSparky) [about](http://j.mp/11ma89z) page:

> I enjoy hearing from readers and listeners. Indeed, it warms the cockles of my heart. However, I am a lousy correspondent and for that I am sorry. I do sometimes reply, but not always.

> For instance, if I write and say “Thanks”, then you reply and say “Thanks for saying thanks”, then I most likely will not reply and say “Thanks for saying thanks to my thanks”, because if I did that, it would require you to reply “Thanks for saying thanks to my thanks for your thanks” and that, of course, would trigger an implosion of the entire universe.
