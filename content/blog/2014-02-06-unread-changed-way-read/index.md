One thing I’ve noticed since publishing [The great Unread for iPhone](/blog/2014-02-05-great-unread-iphone/) yesterday is that I’m much more likely to open the ‘All unread’ items feed than I was when I used Reeder for iPhone.

In BU (Before Unread) times, I tended to browse my feeds by tag. I have about a dozen tags, but usually only view the four that interest me most – Apple, Tech, Typography and Web design – on any given day. Sometimes the remaining eight tags continue clocking up unread items for weeks.

When I compared Unread and Reeder’s start pages, it became clearer why I’m more likely to reach for the all ‘unread’ feed.

Notice how the tags are much more prominent on Reeder’s start page (left screenshot) than they are on Unread’s, with access to ‘Unread’ items lonely and isolated at the top. Unread’s more generous spacing around items in this list view pushes the tags down, not quite out of sight but still less prominent and slightly less accessible than in Reeder. The addition of ‘All articles’ and ‘Starred’ feeds in Unread also helps to ensure tag feeds are less in your face.

In my limited experience so far, this feels like a good thing. Unread items in my least-visited tag feeds are getting a fairer crack of the whip, which means I’m processing their content more often and unread counts are being kept in check. That’s if you can call having 132 unread items keeping your unread count in check…

Unread is available from the App Store, currently priced at $1.99.
