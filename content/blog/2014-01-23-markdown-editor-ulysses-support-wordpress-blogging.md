The developers of Ulysses III, a feature-packed Markdown editor for Mac, announced a short while ago that version 1.2 will use the metaWeblog XML-RPC to plug Ulysses III into popular blogging tools, including WordPress. That means:

> [W]hether you’re running a self-hosted blog or are using an online-service such as WordPress.com, chances are high that 1.2 will allow you to publish your work directly from within the app. No more copy and paste, no more switching between browsers, you know the drill, you hate it as much as everybody else.

Maybe it’s time to revisit my workflow.

Ulysses III for Mac is available from the App Store.
