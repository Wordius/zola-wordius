> Some countries – in particular the UK – have a very high VAT registration threshold. So lots of freelancers and micro-enterprises do not need to register for VAT. However, other countries have a low or even 0 threshold. If you sell your products into those countries then they can demand you register for VAT in their country and submit a VAT return to them OR (in the UK) register for the MOSS, which will deal with paying the VAT due to other member countries for you.

The changes will also affect anyone currently registered for VAT who sells specific goods or services to EU states other than the one they are resident in.
