[*Offscreen* #4](http://www.offscreenmag.com) features some fine web folks, including Dave Greiner, Timoni West, Loren Brichter, Brad Smith and Daniel Weinand, but the reason I’ve been so looking forward to issue #4 is the Jeremy Keith interview. Strange then that the mere fact I’d subscribed to this fine piece of printed matter should slip my mind, a consequence of the avalanche of work that hit in the two months preceding Christmas. The package arriving from mainland Europe this morning may have been a surprise, but I knew immediately what I wanted to read.

Keith gives the impression of having an intellect the size of Mount Fuji. At least that’s the way it appears to someone who doesn’t know – and has never met – the man from Ireland, formerly of Freiburg, Germany, and east coast USA, and current resident of Brighton. Fortunately, Keith also possesses an uncanny ability to know what to write, when to write it, and how. As a result, reading one of his articles or posts – or books for that matter – is nothing like as difficult as scaling a mountain. Instead, you get information and entertainment, and you get it delivered in fine wrapping paper.

The *Offscreen* interview doesn’t disappoint. Here is a man who has lived, well, almost everywhere; a man who finds time to attend local geek nights, to practise – and play – in a band; to travel the world preaching to the (generally) initiated; and to write, and write, and write. It makes me wonder how I manage to squeeze so little into a week, and suggests a rocket should be permanently trained on my ass.

There is much more to appreciate besides the Keith interview. *Offscreen* #4 corners and interrogates many of the web’s finest, and it’s rammed with interesting asides, such as Tobias van Schneider’s gear guide, the process behind Softfacade’s icons, and lessons learned from freelancing. And if you’re still not convinced, maybe the luxurious 135gsm Circlematt paper carefully adorned with H&FJ’s distinctive [Cyclone](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100003) and Jos Buivenga’s always pleasing [Calluna](http://www.exljbris.com/calluna.html) will grab your attention. 

The time I could devote to reading *Offscreen* was cut short today, due to unexpected visitors, an expected grocery shopping trip, and a damned inconveniently broken skylight. The upside of all that is I have a mountain of reading to get through tomorrow. Bring it on.
