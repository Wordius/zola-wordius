I’ve come across some clever apps in my time but nothing quite like Workflowy. The last time I was this impressed by an app was the day I installed [Mr Reader](http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/), an RSS news reader, on my iPad.

Workflowy is a list-making app. Lest your interest should wane and the mere mention of lists send you scurrying for the back button, here are some of Workflowy’s key features:

* It allows you to make lists; that’s a given.
* It gets out of, and stays out of, your way. The keyboard shortcuts panel in the screenshot above can be called with `^ + ?`, and put away using the same key combination.
* Lists look like lists – all nicely bulleted, a bit like this one.
* You can have lists within lists – projects, then.
* Notes per item allow you to add extra information.
* Lists can be synced between the web app and the universal iOS app. There’s currently no Android app, instead the developers recommend using the web app in Chrome.
* It does all this better than any list-making app I’ve ever used.

Workflowy’s makers have been kind enough to make a few short videos to bring users up to speed. And when I say short, I mean short; each video lasts about a minute, meaning you can achieve expert status in around 15 minutes. Essentially, the learning curve is not a curve at all; it’s a perpendicular line. If only life was this simple. If you’re the impatient type, just watch the first one.

### What’s the catch?

Compulsive list makers will have to pay. The web app is free to use (up to 500 items per month); thereafter it requires a subscription, currently $4.99 per month or $49 per year. The iOS app is also free. When I discovered this, I thought I could see a pattern forming; it appears not. The iOS app is free, plain and simple.

As you’d expect, subscribers (Pros), get a few extras:

* Unlimited lists.
* Backup to Dropbox.
* Password protected collaboration, allowing you to share certain projects with specific people.
* Theme and fonts can be changed to personalise Workflowy.
* Premium support: your emails are answered first.

### Verdict

The subscription plan is expensive. If it was set at $12 per year, I could see a lot more users diving in – $12 is $12, but $49 is nearly $50. Maybe the plan is to keep the user base small until new features have been added.

According to the FAQs on the Workflowy site (Help > Support), those new features are in the works, including dates and reminders. That’s encouraging. While the current version of the app is fully functional, some of the planned new features will add that extra bit of polish.

Workflowy’s tagline is ‘a better way to organise your brain’. All I can say is it’s addictive; lists beget lists. Compulsive list makers may find themselves fighting an addiction for which there’s no known cure. Go careful.
