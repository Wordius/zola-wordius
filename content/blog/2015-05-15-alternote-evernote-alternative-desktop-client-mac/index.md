When someone describes you as a “collector” of note-taking apps, it’s pretty clear they’re about to dangle a carrot. That’s precisely what happened when I was approached by the developers of Alternote, an alternative desktop client to Evernote’s mainstream offering that promised Markdown support. That, right there, was the big carrot.

Alternote’s beta app was synced to my Evernote account and having its buttons pressed shortly afterwards. The sync was quick and painless – my ‘notes’ only number in the 100s and mainly comprise PDFs and scans of receipts, emailed receipts and various insurance documents. The PDFs are not downloaded in Alternote. Instead, they are replaced by download links in the notes themselves. Clicking the link causes the PDF to be downloaded to your Downloads folder. Adding it back to the note only results in the creation of a new link, meaning it is not possible to view the contents of a PDF stored in Alternote. This may not suit everyone’s needs. For now, though, let’s take a look at that interface.

### Similar but different

Anyone familiar with Evernote will feel at home in Alternote, although there are differences. Alternote has the same three-pane layout – sidebar, note list and current note. The sidebar can be hidden and the notes list also disappears in full-screen mode, which offers a completely distraction-free writing experience.

The main sections featured in the sidebar are: All Notes, Starred (think Ever note shortcuts), Notebooks, Tags, Trash and, tucked away at the bottom, a dropdown that offers, among other things, options to log out and change the background of the sidebar. The default background is ‘translucent’ – shades of grey and various images are the other choices.

The notes list is much the same as that in Evernote, with each note’s title, the date it was added and the first few words of the entry showing.

The note pane, where all the action happens, is simple. Starting at the top Alternote offers the ability to star a note (add it to your shortcuts in the sidebar), share it (currently limited to copying a link to the clipboard and printing, including to PDF), change the font and size displayed, and switch between day/night and distraction-free modes (hit `escape` to revert to three panes visible when in the latter mode).

Next comes the note title, the note itself and, at the bottom, the ability to add tags to the note and check the word count.

While writing notes, users can access a contextual menu that offers a number of formatting options – heading styles, bold and italic, linking, bulleted, numbered and to-do style lists. Simply highlight a word or block of text to access the menu. The different formats on offer can also be accessed using shortcut keys. See the `Format` menu at the top of the screen for more.

### Getting notes out of Alternote

Evernote is not my main note-taking app, which I have described [elsewhere](/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow), due to its lack of support for Markdown and limited export features – PDF, HTML and Evernote’s proprietary .enex format being the only options.

Currently, Alternote only offers the ability to print, PDF or manually copy and paste a note elsewhere should you need to. Still, I was intrigued enough to delve deeper because Alternote’s developers have indicated that they plan to support Markdown and offer additional export options.

Alternote’s co-founder, Ukrained-based Oleksandr Rakovets, says: “We are planning to implement export methods in further versions of Alternote. I think .txt will be in one of the releases in the closest future. Markdown support will be introduced this July or August with version 2.0, as well as a .md export option.”

### And finally…

Initial impressions are that Alternote is a quick, clean alternative to the somewhat more cluttered default application. With additional export options and Markdown support promised within the next few months, it may well prove to be the app that expands the Evernote fan base by enticing in users from the strictly plain text community. We will see. 

Alternote is available from the App Store at the introductory price of $4.99 (£3.99). According to Rakovets, the price will rise to $6.99 in about a month’s time and subsequently thereafter coinciding with big releases. Version 1.1, due out in June, will bring support for shared and business notebooks.
