When Apple launched the Mac Mini in 2005, I dismissed it as the entry-level Apple machine it was intended to be, and continued to buy increasingly expensive machines, like my iMac and MacBook. But the iMac is 2010-old and the MacBook dates back to 2011, and things have moved on, especially the Mac Mini.

Looking at the specs, it was clear the 2012 Mac Mini 2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, with the RAM maxed out to 16MB, would be more than capable of running my most demanding apps, like Adobe Creative Cloud’s InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator. After a fresh install and a week of use, I’m happy to say, it is.

But there’s a [new Mac Mini on the horizon](http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mac/new-mac-mini-release-date-specs-uk-3472956/), so Apple has lowered prices on the Mac Mini in Europe, but not by much. There are better deals to be had. Other vendors, such as those on Amazon, are keen to shift stock. I picked up my Mac Mini for £563 from Amazon’s [UK store](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&hvadid=26278110531&hvdev=c&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvpone=&hvpos=1t3&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvrand=3758128893898707474&index=aps&keywords=mac%20mini%20quad%20core&linkCode=ur2&ref=pd_sl_6cjborjbwb_b&tag=wordius-21) – £86 less than the official Apple site is charging – and added [16MB of RAM to my basket](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008LXX9OC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B008LXX9OC&linkCode=as2&tag=wordius-21) (£130) to self install. By doing this I saved a tidy £196, paying a total of £693 compared with £889 from Apple. The seller of the model I bought specified ‘Lion installed’, but the Mac Mini arrived with Mavericks pre-installed.  

In the US, where Apple is charging $799 for the quad-core Mac Mini, there don’t appear to [such great deals](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007477COO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007477COO&linkCode=as2&tag=wordius-20&linkId=XKIEZD6RPWN2F7SM), with, currently, only $5 off the official price of the quad-core model.

If you think I sound more than a little chuffed with this deal, you’d be right. Last time I looked at the Dock, Safari, Airmail, InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, [TextExpander](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textexpander-for-mac/id405274824?mt=12&uo=4&at=11l4We), Terminal, Tweetdeck, TextWrangler, Coda 2, MAMP, Things, Evernote, Ulysses and MultiMarkdown Composer 2. My MacBook would have had a fit.
