This past year has been one of trials and tribulations. I’ve tried out many more apps, both free and paid, than you will find listed in this post. Some apps hung around for a while; others were swiftly discarded. With one exception, I use the apps listed below every day. Scrivener is the exception, but only because it’s a heavyweight writing tool that has far more features than I need for everyday writing tasks.

So, to the apps…

### Byword

[Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) is a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) writing app, available on the Mac and iOS. I own both, but do most of my writing in the Mac version. It is set up as my default external text editor in nvALT – Preferences > Editing > External Text Editor (in nvALT) – for those times when I want to hide all the clutter and make use of Byword’s distraction-free writing environment.

I’ve tried many writing apps on my Mac – there are currently more than a dozen installed in the applications folder on my MacBook Pro – but I always return to Byword.

### Mou

I’ve been using [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) on and off since early 2012. Lately, more on than off. The increased usage came about when Mou’s developer introduced the option to sync directly with Scriptogram, this website’s host. That single act simplified my post-publishing workflow considerably: write post, select `^⇧S`, click `OK`. Job done.

Mou’s dual pane – Markdown on the left, HTML-ified output on the right – is useful, although not unique. Mou remains free while in beta. If its developer, Chen Luo (@chenluois), continues to add powerful features like the aforementioned Scriptogram syncing, I can’t see its free status lasting for long.

Oh, and you can auto-post to Tumblr.

### Notesy

[Notesy](http://notesy-app.com/), an iOS-only app, is the most recent addition to my writing arsenal. I use it to access the notes I make on my Mac in nvALT. At one time this task fell to Simplenote, before it started having syncing problems. Read more here: [Abandoning Simplenote: Simple, But Difficult](http://bettermess.com/abandoning-simplenote-simple-but-difficult/), on David Schechter’s A Better Mess.

The Markdown preview in Notesy is a bonus.

### nvALT

[NVAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/) most-used note-taking app comes second only to InDesign in terms of my overall app usage.

Don’t be fooled by nvALT’s free status. It is a full-featured app, indeed fuller-featured than many paid apps.

nvALT supports Markdown (and Textile), has a built-in preview window (⌘^P) and in-app file management, permits file tagging, and can be powered up using Textexpander and Alfred. I could go on… It also syncs beautifully with Notesy, the app I use to read and add notes when on the iPhone or iPad.

The only item on my wishlist for nvALT is inline Markdown highlighting. Otherwise, it’s a truly great app, and one that I couldn’t live without. Hence, I made a donation to help keep its developer, Brett Terpstra, interested.

There appears to be no lack of interest on Terpstra’s part. I’ve been using the latest beta version for a few months without issue; it’s at nvALT 2.2b94 if you’re interested.

### Scrivener

Writing a book? A screenplay? An in-depth post that involves masses of research? Then [Scrivener](http://literatureandlatte.com/) is the app you should be using. It’s a complex tool but one that will pay dividends if you invest the time. Outline, edit, storyboard and write, all in a single, focused environment.

There’s even a *Scrivener for Dummies* manual ([$16.49](http://amzn.to/Ro9YZK) | [£10.87](http://amzn.to/10zpaaB)) to help wandering MS Word deserters over the learning curve.

I find Scrivener useful when I want to gather all my research around me, whether PDFs, web pages or images. Throw everything in a project’s ‘research’ folder and it’s accessible – and readable – from within the app, with no need to launch multiple applications, such as browsers and PDF readers, to open the different file formats.
