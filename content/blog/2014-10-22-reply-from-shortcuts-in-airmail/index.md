Yesterday, MacSparky posted an [update](http://macsparky.com/blog/2014/10/update-to-mail-send-from-trick) to his [Mail Send-From Trick](http://macsparky.com/blog/2012/8/apple-mail-send-from-trick). If you use Apple’s Mail, follow those links to find out more.

Having to lift my hands from the keyboard just to toggle the reply-from menu has been bugging me for some time, especially as I often use three different addresses through the course of the day. The beauty with MacSparky’s trick is that it also works with Airmail. Indeed, it should work with any Mac email client.

When adding these shortcuts, have System Preferences and Airmail open side by side, because it’s important to replicate the reply-from address precisely in the keyboard shortcut. 

The screenshot below shows my reply-from options in Airmail.

And Screenshot 2 shows where the shortcuts are added in System Preferences.

Having lots of different email addresses might sound like more effort than it’s worth, but it’s important to me to separate different aspects of my business and personal life. Besides, they are all set up and processed in [Fastmail](http://www.fastmail.fm/?STKI=11717993), which makes life a whole lot easier. In Airmail, each address is set up as an alias of my main Fastmail address and each has its own signature.
 
Airmail 2 is available from the App Store, priced at £6.99.
