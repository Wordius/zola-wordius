My review of ReadKit for Mac will appear later today. For now, I thought I’d add some comments about free iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad app [Newsify](http://newsify.co). Towards the end of last week Newsify ensured it will remain relevant post–1 July by partnering with feed-reading service [Feedly](http://cloud.feedly.com/%23welcome). For a free app, Newsify is remarkably flexible and usable, but only, in my view, if you change a lot of the default settings. The comments below refer to the iPhone app.

Here are a few changes I suggest you make to the default settings to improve your reading experience: 

* Turn off thumbnails (removes them in list and newspaper view – newspaper view is pointless on small screens);
* Set the article font-size to large;
* Set the mobilizer to Readability;
* You could also turn off favicons, but I prefer to leave them on as they help to identify the sources of articles (I’m more inclined to read some than others).

Under advanced settings:

* Set larger fonts to ‘on’;
* Set the title font to ‘Alternative Bold Condensed’;
* Add your default email address under ‘Default recipients’ (saves starting to type it out every time if you often email articles to yourself, as I do. I experienced some strange behaviour, with the screen jumping every time I typed a letter or two in the email field. Persevere, then forget about this anomaly. It works otherwise).

In article view:

* Adjust the sharing settings to suit; there are plenty to choose from. I won’t list them all here, but Twitter, Facebook, Pinboard, Evernote, and all the read-later services are included.

## Conclusion

Personally, I plan to adopt a paid feed-reading service in the near future (for the first few months I will run a free service, such as Feedly, in parallel – if I can get such a system to work). But if you’re looking for a free service end to end – unperturbed by the knowledge that the Google Reader closure was so cut-and-dried because the search giant had no customers to worry about – you could do a lot worse than combining Feedly with Newsify.
