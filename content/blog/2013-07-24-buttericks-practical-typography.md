Other than a brief skip through *Butterick’s Practical Typography*, I confess, I’ve yet to read it front to back. But that brief dip – if the title wasn’t already a complete giveaway – was enough to give me a feel for what this book is about and, equally important, what it’s like to read. *A rivetting alternative* might spring to mind if you’ve ever read the typographers’ bible that is Robert Bringhurst’s *[The Elements of Typographic Style](http://amzn.to/13a3UEL)* ([UK](http://amzn.to/12iL98b)).

In contrast to Bringhurst’s wordy prose, author Matthew Butterick has a plain, common sense, occasionally humorous tone when dispensing advice on how to improve your typography. Here’s the first of five rules in the chapter ‘Typography in 10 minutes’:

> The ty­po­graph­ic qual­i­ty of your doc­u­ment is de­ter­mined large­ly by how the body text looks. Why? Because there’s more body text than any­thing else. So start every project by mak­ing the body text look good, then wor­ry about the rest. 

*Butterick’s Practical Typography* includes chapters on type composition, text formatting, font recommendations, page layout, as well as sample documents and a useful appendix. There’s also an introduction by [Erik Spiekermann](http://spiekermann.com/en/) and the author even finds space – being a web-based book, space is infinite, I suppose – for an entire chapter on Times New Roman, and why you shouldn’t. You just shouldn’t.

> When Times New Roman ap­pears in a book, doc­u­ment, or adver­tise­ment, it con­notes ap­a­thy. It says, “I sub­mit­ted to the font of least re­sis­tance.” Times New Roman is not a font choice so much as the ab­sence of a font choice, like the black­ness of deep space is not a col­or. To look at Times New Roman is to gaze into the void.

If *Butterick’s Practical Typography* comprised fine paper, bound with care, I guess it would be plausible to say it warranted a place on every typographer’s bookshelf. But it’s not; it’s a web-based book. Maybe “its URL deserves a spot among every typographer’s bookmarks” would make more sense.

### Pay your way

The author has adopted a novel approach to allowing readers to pay for his work, from free to $90+ via a font purchase. There are [lots of ways to pay](http://practicaltypography.com/how-to-pay-for-this-book.html). If you insist on a cash deposit, around $10 sounds about right for a work of this quality, length and scope. Alternatively, consider getting the book for free an incentive to add to your font collection or buy the author’s other book, *[Typography for Lawyers](http://amzn.to/1bN3cGz)* ([UK](http://amzn.to/13cZs8U)). 

I’ve added *Butterick’s Practical Typography* to my ever-expanding reading list and promise to cough up once I’ve had the chance to read it through properly. Typographer’s honour.
