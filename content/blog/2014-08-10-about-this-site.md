This is a stub post. It serves only to tell you that this site is a work in progress. My main blog still lives in WordPress. The site you are looking at is built in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which transforms my plain old [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files into a static website.

This blog is no stranger to flat, file-based website systems. A couple of years ago, it was built in [Kirby](http://getkirby.com), then I switched back to WordPress. At the time, some features I wanted to add were easier to achieve in WordPress, plus my knowledge and understanding of Kirby’s templating language left something to be desired.

But while running my blog in WordPress, the page weight kept creeping up. Much of that extra weight was down to plugins, which brought with them pounds of their own, and the occasional clash of personality. With limited knowledge of WordPress’ architecture, you can achieve almost anything you want by deploying plugins. But they don’t always like one another, and can bring with them a lot of buggy, poorly written code.

Enough was enough, I decided to look again at file-based content management systems. I have lived on this edge many times before, but on this occasion, one file-based system stood out… 

## Enter Jekyll  

Coming soon…
