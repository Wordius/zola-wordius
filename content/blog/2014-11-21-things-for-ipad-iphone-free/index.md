The iPad and iPhone versions of Things, the task management app, are currently available for free from the App Store. That’s a saving of $19.99 on the iPad version and $9.99 on the iPhone app.

Developer [Cultured Code](http://culturedcode.com/things/) is also offering a 30% discount on the Mac version of Things, down from $49.99 to $34.99.

The Things Cloud keeps your to-dos in sync across all of your devices, while integration with Reminders automatically feeds to-dos from a specific list in that app directly into your Things inbox.

Having trialled both OmniFocus and Things a couple of years ago, I opted for Things’ cleaner lines and simpler approach to getting things done. Things worked from the moment I launched the app for the first time, unlike OmniFocus, which required a devilish amount of input and setting up.
