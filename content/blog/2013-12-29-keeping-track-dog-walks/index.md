From time to time, I like to keep track of how far we’ve walked with our dog, Roma. When my hunger for data can’t be satisfied by counting every last step, I use the MotionX GPS app for iPhone. A side benefit of using an app is that when my wife asks the inevitable, “How far do you think we’ve walked today?”, I have the answer sitting in the palm of my hand.

MotionX GPS is easy to use, provides masses of data – more than we will ever need, including elapsed time, average speed, distance, maximum speed, total ascent/descent and gradients – and allows you to associate images with different points along your route. You can also specify modes of travel, such as on foot, on four legs, on two wheels (or four), and save and share tracks so that others can follow in your footsteps, sorry paw prints.

It’s worth bearing in mind that GPS apps have a habit of draining your battery quickly. If you’re planning a full day out, be prepared and take along some extra juice. [Mophie’s Juice Pack PowerStation](http://amzn.to/1ejw73f) is compact and its high-output battery allows for fast charging.

MotionX GPS for iPhone costs $1.99 and is available from the App Store.
