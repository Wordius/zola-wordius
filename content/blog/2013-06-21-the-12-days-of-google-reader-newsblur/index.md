Newsblur is not new to me, but it might as well be. I signed up within hours of Google announcing its intentions to close Reader. Since then, Newsblur’s design has improved and it has invested in faster, more responsive servers. It had to. Shortly after the announcement, like many other feed-reading services, Newsblur experienced a spike in new users, including several thousand paying customers. I was among those who signed up for a free account, or a testing account as I prefer to call it. The 64-feed limit is nowhere near enough to accommodate all my interests, but it’s plenty to discover how well the service fits my needs. Newsblur should be congratulated for taking this approach; too many services have opted for the pay-now, pay-later approach, which is the point at which you discover a service doesn’t fit your needs. This review is based on my experience with a free acount, using Newsblur’s web interface and iPad app. Newsblur also provides free, native apps for the iPhone and Android. If that doesn’t cover all your bases, it’s also supported on the Mac by third-party app ReadKit.

### Who is behind Newsblur?

Developer Samuel Clay began work on Newsblur in summer 2009. It launched to the public in mid 2010 and Clay added premium accounts in October the same year. With backing from seed funder

[Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/index.html), starting in 2012, Clay was able to add new and improved features, such as Blurblogs – social sharing – improved intelligence training, as well as the iPad and Android apps. Clay’s Twitter profile (@samuelclay) describes him as the ‘Founder of NewsBlur, friend to the animals.’ All of this you can discover from Clay’s bio. I am ashamed to say I can’t add more substance, except that I am also ‘friend to the animals’: one dog, four cats, and ex-horse! Anyway, let’s get to it.

### Interface: web

My first encounter with Newsblur, back in March this year, was with the web interface. It was brief, so brief that I didn’t bother to check out the iPad app. I think I know why that was.

Socialising, sharing and site stats dominate the front page. That’s not what I’m looking for in a feed reader; I want to get straight down to it; ‘it’ being the content of my feeds. When I last looked, though, Newsblur’s ‘front page’ was showing 7,077 premium users and 9,545 standard users, so maybe I’m not necessarily Newsblur’s target user. And, besides, the web interface isn’t as important to me as it might be to some. I’m more interested in how Newsblur performs as a backend, and serving up those feeds to an iPad app. Skip past Newsblur’s front page, select an article to read and it’s a different story. Article view is well laid out and set in Lucida Sans (default). There’s also an option to change this to ‘Georgia, serif’ in `Preferences > Stories`, but it wasn’t working when I tried it. It’s possible there are some differences here between the free and premium services that I wasn’t aware of.

The tools menu pops up when you click the gear icon at the bottom of the sidebar. Here, you’ll find a comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts, covering navigation and actions. If you remember one keyboard shortcut, remember this one: `?`. The question mark is the shortcut to access all shortcuts, which should come in handy if you’re new to the service. Newsblur’s Intelligence Trainer allows you to filter what you do and don’t like by clicking on tags. There’s no way to add tags of your own, though. Nor does Newsblur include a search feature. Endless scrolling is your only option when you want to retrieve an article from the dim and distant past. If a service offers sharing, saving, starring, etc., then it should also provide a search facility. The tools menu also includes access to your profile, Blurblog, friends and followed, and preferences. Under preferences there are more options to determine how the Newsblur web interface looks and behaves, with some fine-tuning for feeds view, article view and keyboard shortcuts, the latter being a premium feature. Quite why it’s a premium feature, I don’t know. Overall, there’s precious little opportunity to change the look and feel of the Newsblur web interface. In this case, I don’t see that as too much of a problem; Newsblur already has a good, basic design that most users should find acceptable.

### Interface: iPad

Newsblur’s free iPad app has a very similar feel, in more ways than one. Assuming you’ve already gone through the login process, the app’s ‘homepage’ displays a list of your feed folders on the left and a big, blank waste of space on the right. Or is it? Actually, it isn’t. It’s only blank because I haven’t interacted with anyone. Interactions and activities can be toggled using the buttons at the bottom. I can’t help thinking, though, that this is where Newsblur should display ‘All’ latest posts.

{{ image(path="gr-newsblur-ipad-homepage-600-io.jpg", caption="Newsblur: iPad homepage") }}

Tap on a feed folder to bring up its article list, unread only or all, depending on your preference. Then tap an article to open it in the right-hand pane.

Toggle between ‘Story’, which is how the article appears in its feed, and ‘Text’, a stripped-back representation of the article. Tap the Safari article (top right) to view in Newsblur’s built-in browser. The gear icon (top right) gives access to a number of features available in the web interface, including training. Interestingly, this is where I discovered that there’s a distinction between ‘sharing’ and ‘send to’. With ‘send to’ you can send articles to Twitter with their original link. With the ‘sharing’ option, an article sent to Twitter links back to your Blurblog. Hmm! If the default font is not to your liking, you can change to the non-default font, Georgia, in the drop down – those are your two choices. You can also adjust the font-size between 12pt and 17pt. As you can see from the screenshot above, I prefer big and Georgia. Despite some niggles, I think Newsblur’s iPad app gives a good account of itself, both in terms of usability and readability.

### Sharing

Sharing is the caring core of Newsblur. The web interface allows you to decide which sharing options should be enabled in article view; you’ll find them under `Preferences > Stories`. Choose from Twitter, Facebook, Readability, Instapaper, Pinboard, Diigo, Kippt, Evernote, Google+, Pocket, Tumblr and Delicious. I don’t know about you, but that list covers all my needs. Then there’s *Blurblog*, Newsblur’s built-in community feature. I won’t go into Blurblog in any detail. If you want another community presence, go ahead. Personally, all I want to do is share with my existing networks: Twitter (most often), Pinboard (often), Google+ (occasionally) and Facebook (rarely). Newsblur has those covered. Free accounts are public facing. Everything you share is public and automatically added to your Blurblog. Premium accounts offer the ability to ‘protect’ your shares or make them ‘private’. I’m not sure I need to wear protection when I’m reading my feeds but keeping things private sounds good to me. As I mentioned earlier, there is one other aspect of sharing in Newsblur that bothers me: the appended links in Twitter. Instead of sharing the original link, Newsblur links back to your Blurblog. That is going to annoy the hell out of friends, family and followers; that is, unless you’re all deeply connected through your respective Blurblogs. This is wrong in so many ways. If you’re sharing from the iPad app you can avoid this by using ‘send to’ Twitter instead, accessible via the gear icon above articles.

### Cost

Newsblur offers a free account with a 64-feed limit. The free account offers plenty of opportunity to find out whether you like the service or not, but it’s not a solution for serious RSS users. The premium account, on the other hand, offers unlimited sites, more frequent updates and public, protected and private sharing for an annual fee of $24. Don’t complain about the cost; we’re talking a year’s entertainment here. The iPad, iPhone and Android apps are free. Obviously, they’re useless if you don’t have a Newsblur account.

### Conclusion

Newsblur’s premium account costs $24 a year. That’s a price I’m happy to pay for a feed delivery service. And by the time I’ve completed this series I *will* be paying to have my feeds delivered. In light of what happened with Google Reader, relying entirely on a free service that doesn’t have a viable business plan just doesn’t make sense. As far as Newsblur is concerned, the interfaces – web and iPad – are not entirely to my liking, but this in itself is not a deal breaker. The web interface isn’t a place I go very often; the iPad app is constantly improving, and there’s still a chance one of my preferred iPad apps will adopt Newsblur as its backend. But I have other concerns. I’m guessing this might be an isolated issue, but I experienced a lot of stickiness in the web interface when trying to check feeds this morning (and evening, now) – always ‘fetching stories’, never ‘feeding’. I had to repeatedly log out and log back in again to get a folder of stories (in some cases there was only a single story) to load. What I don’t understand is why the iPad app didn’t exhibit the same issues. Newsblur is *one for the future*, which is to say I’m not discounting it entirely. As I’ve said elsewhere, I consume RSS feeds on my iPad, most of the time, anyway. The web interface, and the backend that propels it, just has to keep delivering.

**Tomorrow:** Multiple choice.
