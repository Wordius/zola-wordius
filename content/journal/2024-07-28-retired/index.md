What does anyone go into retirement hoping for? No more work – check. No more 9-5 – check. Time to spend the way you want to, not the way someone expects you to. Most of the time, anyway.

But think about it: when you retire at 67 – or some other random number, just as long as it’s late in your lifetime – you’ve only got 13.9 years to live, with the average age of death being 80.90 years in the UK. For my US friends, it’s only 77.28 years, in case you were wondering. That’s, give or take a point, 14 years left to do everything you ever wanted to do after leaving behind the drudge of going to work every, single day. There’s even talk about increasing the [state pension age in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/proposed-new-timetable-for-state-pension-age-increases). 

Assuming you’ve made it to 67, you’ll likely have all manner of things going wrong, such as heart attacks, strokes, cancers, arthritis, you name it. Even the fittest among us are not immune to cancer. So that once-in-a-lifetime cruise of the Caribbean, or what have you, might well be your last.

That’s why the introduction of the mobile phone proved such a winner for me, despite my inner self telling me I didn’t want one. Secretly, I loved gadgets. Oh, and [watches](/tags/wristcheck).

I got to thinking about this only a few years ago. I’ve been in ‘early retirement’ since 1 September 2002, when I was 37. Yes, I worked late, because I chose to. I worked long hours, because I chose to. I worked weekends, because I chose to. I worked all this time, because I was young enough to cope with it. But, get this, the client I worked for only produced that work for four months of the year, from September up to Christmas. Until the next September rolled around. And that went on for ten years, until I had had enough and other work came along.

At first, I earned a lot and we spent it. Fuck, did we spend it. Before I kick myself into oblivion for not saving more at the time, think about it. I was in early retirement, the good times had already started for me at that ‘young’ age. And the good times rolled on for another 10 years or so. 

Travelling overseas; flying with our parents business class to the US while we still had the opportunity; taking them to places they’d never been in Europe or the UK; having long weekends away; taking multiple trips a year; skiing, sometimes twice a year. You name it, we did it. (Apart from bungee jumping – we didn’t do that.) They were good years. On the plus side, we were young enough to enjoy them.

Of course, it helped that I worked in a field that allowed me to go self employed. It enabled me to ‘go freelance’, aka into semi retirement. At 37 I left behind all the cruft that comes with working full time: the office politics, the bitching, the meetings that went on for hours (apart, that is, from the occasional phone call meeting, if you can call it that). No more Monday mornings for me; no more working late unless I chose to. 

Nowadays, as I approach my 60th, I might not earn as much, but then I don’t need to. We’ve paid off our mortgage. Settled all our debts. And we’re happy as things are.

I do 16–20 hours a week gardening, just to give myself something to do. Get me out of the house, in the open air

So, I urge you, if the opportunity presents itself, whether that’s to go freelance or self employed or by some other means become your own boss – the boss of your time – grab it with both hands. Take the highs with the lows, and run with it. You’ll find life becomes much more enjoyable once you start living it.

Explore the lower limits of what it takes to survive – hopefully you won’t have to – and the upper limits of where you want to be. Find a medium at which you are happy. Just don’t go the whole hog. 

Boss your own life…
