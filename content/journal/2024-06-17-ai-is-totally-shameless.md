Paul Ford writing about artificial intelligence:

> … it’s just software. And not even _that much_ software: Lots of AI models could fit on a thumb drive with enough room left over for the entire run of _Game of Thrones_ (or Microsoft Office). They’re interdimensional ZIP files, glitchy JPEGs, but for all of human knowledge. And yet they serve such large portions! (Not always. Sometimes I ask the AI to make a list and it gives up. “You can do it,” I type. “You can make the list longer.” And it does! What a terrible interface!)
