I don’t necessarily love coming across old, unfinished blog posts like this one, but I thought it was worth finishing this from our family holiday at Colwyn Bay in north Wales, I believe, in 1972. It is taken from my days on Blogspot and Tumblr, wrestling with the idea of writing a blog, and never quite getting there. 

> ## 1972 North Wales
>
> There’s one phrase you’ll never read in a holiday brochure promoting this part of the world: ‘Come to sunny Wales’. At least, I hope you won’t. It would be a lie, after all. A big one. I don’t apologise for repeating myself when I say that it rains a lot in Wales.
>
> My best guess is that this holiday took place in the summer of 1972. After the disaster that was the Robin Hood Holiday Camp, Rhyl, of 1971 \[from a previous post], I think my parents saw their choice of a B&B in Llandudno as a safer option. It would prove otherwise.  
>
> ### Getting there
>
> Back in the 1970s my dad seemed to change his car frequently, usually because the cars he bought were old, and prone to breaking down. In those days people drove a lot less than they do in 2011. Yet my dad always seemed to buy cars that had been around the clock. Sometimes twice. We didn’t have a lot of money, but my dad wasn’t great at spotting a bargain either.  
>
> The arrival of a ‘new’ car was often met by my mum saying ‘They saw you coming, Ronnie’. She would usually prove to be right. The colour of 1972 was grey, or maybe dark green; the cut was a battleship-sized Ford Zephyr. It took up all of our drive and wouldn’t fit in the garage. But it had four doors, so mum was sort of happy.  
>  
> Mum always claimed that she insisted on four doors for safety reasons. But I think it had more to do with the fact that I got car sick going to the shops. On any journey of length she would carry a supply of bags and cloths, 'just in case'. It wasn’t a case of if, but when, and when the bags and cloths ran out, we had to hope a layby wasn’t too far away. Over the years my dad became something of an expert in 'Laybys on the A5', the main road that took us to North Wales. It could have been his specialist subject on Mastermind.  
>  
> I’m not certain me being car sick was entirely due to motion sickness. My dad’s overtaking manoeuvres count among the most frightening experiences I’ve ever had. He didn’t overtake very often, but when he did he struck fear into his passengers and other road users alike. I think he pulled out and expected the car he was attempting to overtake to slow down, because there was never any sign that we were accelerating. Before long there would be flashing headlights coming towards us, and two near misses as my dad swerved back to the other side of the road, in the process chopping up the car he had been overtaking.  
> 
> I think my control freak nature is a product of my dad’s driving. I don’t like flying, but I think I could fly a plane.  
>  
> ### What was happening \[in 1972]?  
>  
> The US withdrew the last of its ground troops from Vietnam, _Simon & Garfunkel_ reunited briefly to perform at Madison Square Gardens (NYC), _The Eagles_ released their self-titled debut album, and the 1972 Summer Olympics – soon to become known as The Munich Massacre – were held in West Germany.

> Net curtain views

> Grey owners  

And so it ends with a few notes on ‘important’ things I had to remember when I returned to writing.
