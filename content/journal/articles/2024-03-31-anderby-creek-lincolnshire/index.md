**DAYS OUT LINCOLNSHIRE**

{{ image(path="DSC_0099.png", caption="Spotting this house for sale one weekend was all the encouragement I needed to head to the beach") }}
 
If there’s one place we can take Roma and Dotty, our two lurchers, and let them run to their hearts’ content, it’s the beach. They run and run and run, chasing balls or each other, but all of the while having a great time. What’s more, they are absolutely flaked out by the time it’s all over, and we get to enjoy a quiet ride home in the car.

So, when we moved further north in Lincolnshire in 2017, I felt certain that our favourite beach, Old Hunstanton, would no longer be the closest to us. But plugging the details into my GPS proved it still was.

Then, while flicking through the Sunday Times Home section, I came across a house for sale. It wasn’t the house that interested me, it was the intriguingly named place it was located, Anderby Creek. Just five minutes further than Old Hunstanton, it lies on the Lincolnshire coast, north of Skegness.

But the contrast between Skegness and Anderby Creek couldn’t be more stark. I remember visiting Skegness as a child and never getting to see the water, so far out was the tide. Just a few miles north, at Anderby Creek, the tide always seems to be in, give or take a few feet. Plus there’s none of the bingo halls, fair rides and kiss-me-quick hat sellers to spoil your day.

The village of Anderby Creek is home to a beach cafe, a beach and the world’s first Cloud Bar, from where you can spot your cirruses and cumulonimbuses, but are unable to order a drink! It is as unspoilt as they come.

And getting there is all part of the fun, as the journey takes you across the stunning Lincolnshire Wolds, assuming you’re coming from the west, with its best-kept villages and quaint little towns.

But let’s not forget why we’re here, the beach. Head up to the beach from the car park, turn left – dogs mustn’t go right for part of the year and, besides, you’d eventually end up in Skegness – and you are presented with mile upon mile of sandy beach, that runs for as far as the eye can see, and beyond.

The beach itself plunges steeply to the sea, which might explain the relentless crashing of big rollers onto the beach. They are constant, and, seemingly, ever present.

After a long walk, it was nice to come off the beach, tuck the dogs away in the car to chill out after all their exercise and head for the cafe. We bought lunch and a hot drink and headed back to the car to enjoy our lunches, while our dogs had theirs. Dogs are welcome in the cafe garden but not the cafe itself.

Anderby Beach

Anderby Creek, Lincolnshire PE24 5XT

Anderby Beach Cafe, Sea Road, Anderby Creek, Lincs PE24 5XW

The cafe only serves half of its menu in the winter months, which means most of the hot stuff is off menu. If you fancy fish and chips, visit Sutton-on-Sea, five miles to the north, where you will find Waldo’s (suttononsea.info/waldos-traditional-fish-and-chips) or Sea Breeze restaurant (seabreeze-restaurant.co.uk), both of which come highly recommended. And Sutton-on-Sea is another dog-friendly beach, from the Promenade to The Pullover, in the Furlong Road area!
