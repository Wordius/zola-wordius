Hello, and welcome to my journal and site.

This site is made in [Zola](https://getzola.com) and presented using a simple CSS file. No themes or plugins, so far, have been used in its creation. I’m quite proud of that.

It is presented in four sections:

- The Journal: you are here, where I write about the workings of this site, bits of what little I know about code, and other general stuff. Most of my time will be spent in here.
- The Blog: free software available for the Mac and iOS. What this site is about, in other words. It includes some of my original posts, published variously while under the influence of WordPress, GetKirby and Jekyll, another static site generator like this one. Apologies in advance for the quality of some the images, which have not stood up to passing through so many resizes.
- Advice on stroke: I occasionally make observations about life after a stroke.
- Articles: where I even more occasionally put up some of any articles I have written that appeared in print. It is by no means all the writing I have done, just a selection.

I have given it the most basic styling, some of which I like and some of which I will improve over time. Lists, for example, are in their most basic form. Take a look at my [reading](/reading), the [software I use](/uses), [colophon](/colophon) and [blogroll](/blogroll) pages, and you will see what I mean.

There is a simple navigation system that allows you to page through the blog, and there are RSS feeds per section, so you can pick and choose what you want to read.
