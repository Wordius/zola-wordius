Cheap as chips, but does as advertised. It tells the time, loud and clear.

The time is big, the date is obvious and the day is discreet but still visible. The important stuff is up front and the secondary stuff is, well, secondary.

As well as the time and date functions, there’s an auto-calendar up to 2049, chime, stopwatch, timer, alarm, 12/24 hour format and dual time. Plus it’s water-resistant to 100m and it comes with a silicone strap. I’d forgotten how much I missed the feel of my old watch by Emporio Armani – not sure which model but all I know is I wore it every day. It had a rubber strap, as opposed to silicone, but it had the same comforting feeling. 

It is also lightweight, at only 30g, has a clear display with a backlight (turned on by pressing the S2 button, bottom right), and it’s extremely comfortable to wear. So comfortable, in fact, that I often continue wearing it into the weekend, forgetting that this is one of my working-week watches. I own a few of these with slightly different features.

A solid piece of kit from Seiko, the makers of more upmarket watches. In this, the bottom range of the watch segment occupied by Lorus, prices range from 16 euros to around 160 euros.

Batteries are claimed to last up to two years.

The manual comes in English, with Dutch, French and German versions available from the [Lorus website](https://www.loruswatches.com/Instructions?cv=Z028).
