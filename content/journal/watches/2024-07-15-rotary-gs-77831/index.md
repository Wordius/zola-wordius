I’ve owned this watch for more than 20 years, since well before I got married, which just happens to be 20 years ago this year. I know that because a) my wife keeps  reminding me that our 20th anniversary is this year and, b), because I wore the cufflinks that came with the watch to our wedding. I’ve never worn them since, by the way, nor have I worn any other cufflinks. Cufflinks aren’t my thing.

The watch, on the other hand, is definitely my thing. I say this, not because its small case diameter happens to make my skinny wrists look enormous, but because it has the look of a watch from yesteryear, as do some of my other watches.

The price quoted above is an example of what the watch is currently available for. I can only find it listed on a amazon.com. Although I’ve lost all the receipts, I know what I paid for it was in that ballpark. 

What has happened in the intervening years? A lot, but we don’t have to go there. I replaced the strap after about 15 years with one from TStrap ([Amazon UK](https://amzn.to/4eZkFPv)), which was almost as chunky as the original; other than that, this Rotary has only needed a battery change every few years to keep it ticking along.

I did ask Rotary to do the  battery change initially, but they wanted to do a full service after just a couple of years of ownership. The price they quoted was considerably more than I paid for the watch. It was also a lot more than I pay for the annual service on my car!

The batteries might not outlive me, but this watch certainly will.
