Racing retro aesthetic is how the marketing people put it. But for a firm that saw its origins in Switzerland before moving its HQ to London – who knows why – and now finds itself in the backwaters of Essex, the company has certainly downshifted and moved into the slow lane.

That said, this is a cool watch, even if it’s only designed in Cool Britannia. The rest of it is taken care of, well, you know where: where they make everything from bedpans and toilet brushes to the latest iPhone and Tesla cars. 

The watch has a tonneau, barrel-shaped, stainless steel case, a design that is believed to have originated with Cartier back in 1906: ‘intended to conform to the wrist with its sumptuous curves’, as the marketing ‘gurus’ of the day put it.

I like a watch that sits back on the wrist, relaxes, not one that shouts ‘look at me’ like so much bling every time it’s revealed. It has to be quiet. And, to give it its due, this watch is certainly quiet. 

Waterproof to 50m, which means it’s about okay to wash your hands – cold water only, please. The black leather strap is not something I’ve come to expect from Rotary; it’s a bit flimsy, and a bit narrow in my opinion. I will look out for an upgrade more in keeping with its racing heritage, but I’ll make do, for now.

If weak lumens puts you off, then this watch won’t appeal, but if you’re not worried how it looks in the night and are more interested in how it feels on your wrist, then I’d encourage you to give the Avenger Sport a spin. Just don’t shout about it.
