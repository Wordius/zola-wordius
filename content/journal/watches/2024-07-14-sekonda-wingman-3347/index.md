My wife said I should get back to playing golf. To my way of thinking, I did. I bought a watch. 

Given that the average round of golf costs £50 in the UK nowadays, my first round of golf came in at a well below par price. (Note to self: spare cash for future ‘rounds’.)

This is a simple, classic-looking watch, despite its luminescent dial and hands, that works well for any occasion. That’s as long as you’re wearing navy or, perhaps, white. The simple analog display with date is surrounded by an alloy case with a textured dial and set off by a black nylon strap. I may change this in time.

When I got it, it reminded me of why I preferred a backlight – took me right back to growing up in the 1970s, getting up for school. When you first wake and look at your watch, it’s like looking at a mud pie on your wrist. It’s not until your eyes adjust to the darkness that things start to sharpen up and you can make out the time.

Understated looks from the British design-led firm and made in China. A lot of watch for very little money or, as Sekonda likes to say, ‘real quality, realistic price’.
