I thought I was unique, one of a kind, till I discovered the hashtag #Wristcheck on Mastodon, and there are no less than eight participants already. Fuck, so I’m not alone. I’m not the only one who enjoys this kind of ‘wristography’, or watch porn. I’m an eager participant in this pastime, which is dominated by ‘wristosseurs’, many with deep pockets or, at least, deeper than mine. 

As far as finances go, I am not willing to pay more than £200 (sort of) for a watch. I don’t see the point, and I don’t have a bottomless tip jar. So don’t expect to see a Breitling, a TAG or a Rolex here (unless I happen to have bought it on a beach in Portugal) – those are for the rich, and people like my wife who just happens to own a TAG. Unless, of course, some mysterious benefactor happens to leave me one in their will. Nor will you see any ‘smart’ watches, because I’m simply not into wearing a glorified computer on my wrist, even if it can alert me that I’m about to have a crash. I probably know that already.  

I won’t be participating daily. I have my ‘garden’ or ‘odd jobs’ watch, which I wear Monday to Friday, but I need to make a point of changing it at the weekend or when I go out. Sometimes I don’t.

For the record, I have particularly skinny wrists at 17.5cm or 7in around, so anything over 40mm looks like I got dressed in my big brother’s clothes for school, were I to have had a big brother.

It’s also part of the reason my watch collection has been slimmed down. I sold off a few a couple of years ago. At its height there were nine watches, including, among them, a large-faced Rotary and gold-coloured Timex, bought by mistake. Granted that’s not a massive collection, but it’s still more than many.

I am a strictly platinum man, so no gold here, nor any platinum for that matter. Let’s call me a strictly metal man or, at a stretch, a silver man.

So, without further ado, here is my ‘garden’ watch, the Casio G-Shock G-3157.

The G-3157 does one thing particularly well; it tells the time. It also gives the date and day at a glance, which is handy. There are a number of other things it does, like transforming it into a wrist compass or thermometer, but I’ve rarely made use of these abilities. Telling the time and date is what I look for in a watch. Oh, and it must look good.
