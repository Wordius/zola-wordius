This watch suffers from something of an identity crisis: designed in Italy, manufactured in Singapore, with its movement made in Japan. But out of this crisis comes a watch that works and looks good. Probably because the designers, being Italian, know a thing or three about design, and the Singaporeans know a thing or two about manufacturing. And, as for the Japanese, they are known for making the best quartz movements in the world, among other things.

Besides, don’t all watches these days have an identity crisis: designed in one place, manufactured in another, with a movement that’s, if they’re serious about making watches, Japanese.

Made from marine-grade stainless steel, 316L, as most diving watches are unless, of course, you happen to own a Rolex. Then you’re looking at 904L stainless steel. The key differences are slightly fewer points of carbon, a couple more of molybdenum and the addition of copper into their mix for the Rolex version. All of which makes it slightly less rust prone and more polishable, according to Rolex’s marketing people. There’s not much to write home about, in other words.

I should add that 904L stainless steel isn’t entirely the preserve of Rolex, nor is it owned by the aforesaid company; Omega got there first with its Ploprof, or Seamaster 600, and the steel is free for anyone to use. Just most choose not to. Omega, by the way, has its own version of stainless steel, you guessed it, O-megasteel. Interestingly, though, Omega chooses to use 316L in the current version of the Seamaster. It’s all a bit confusing, if you ask me. They’re looking to split hairs to give marketing some extra words to play with.

Back to the Ratio then, its 316 stainless steel case comes with sapphire glass (scratch resistant and shock proof) and it is water resistant to 200m, although the most it’s ever likely to see is a plunge in the pool and, even then only rarely, because I hate the water, unless it happens to be a shower, and I’m not one for lazing around on a sun bed surrounded by lots of drunk tourists and their kids.

One thing is certain, this watch, with a case of diameter of 40mm, is solidly built and held securely in place on the wrist by its silicon strap, which is extremely comfortable to wear. And, being a quartz, its timing is ultra reliable, as you’d expect from Japan’s VX42 movement.

If I’m honest I would have preferred a yellow dial but that’s nitpicking. The orange grew on me quickly and I happen to love wearing this watch, almost above any other in my collection of watches.

If this watch has an identity crisis, make mine a double.
