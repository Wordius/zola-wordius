The humble euphorbia, or spurge, has got to be one of my favourite plants. It’s not flashy, not in-yer-face. Most of the year, it just sits looking comfortable in its own understated way. Or, at least, ours does. Because this image shows part of our garden. Most other examples I’ve come across look like, not to put too fine a point on it, shit.

They are, usually, planted up against houses or walls, or they’re crowded out in borders jam-packed with a bunch of other plants, be they flowers or shrubs, all fighting for that bit of space, room to breath, light. In such situations, the euphorbia finds it difficult to compete. It is easily bullied into submission and, hence, tends to look like something you wouldn’t serve your dog for dinner.

When we bought our house eight years ago, this plant was in a similar situation, competing with trees and other shrubs. 

This particular variety is hardy and remains year-round, with its mound of blue-green foliage. It puts out its wonderful flower display in May–June.

Plants range from 10cm tall, suitable for small borders, to giants getting to more than 1.8m, or 6ft in old money. In terms of conditions, they cover every angle from those that need protecting in winter, to ones that will flourish in dry conditions or those that tolerate shady, moist conditions.
