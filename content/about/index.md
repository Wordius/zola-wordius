This site is about my experiences of having a stroke, albeit a minor one, a transient ischaemic attack or TIA for short.

I had it at around 9am on 27 April 2022. I was just sitting around waiting to go to work. I’m self-employed if that explains why I was still at home at at that time.

My wife was upstairs. She’d asked me to get the broom out of my car. I stood up with what I thought was a dead leg. It wasn’t. I walked out to the car, steadying myself against the house. I came back with the broom, still leaning against the house. Walked through the back door and staggered to the couch. By this time my wife was downstairs. “What’s wrong with you?” she said. “I think I’m having a stroke,” was my reply.

This site tells my story over the past year or so – what has happened, what to expect… If indeed, you can expect anything, because I’m told strokes affect everyone differently. But you might find some of it useful; I hope you do, but I hope you don’t have to.
