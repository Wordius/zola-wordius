This website is not about the Next Big Thing to come out of Apple – although I may provide the occasional update – but about second-hand Macs, iPhones, iPads, and ancillary equipment, and free, occasionally, paid-for software. There has to be a good reason when I pay for software.

I’ve been out of the loop for some time now, but the cost of apps appears to have rocketed in recent years, not to mention that, most, have gone down the subscription route. These days I rarely sign up for an app that requires a subscription, beyond storage. I’ve learnt that lesson over the years.

Buying software used to be like buying a car – you paid the bulk of your money up front then drip fed it as time went on to keep it on the road. Eventually you might have to upgrade to a newer model. Now there is one point of entry, and you’re in, but those upgrades, small as they are, are paid for via your subscription. Same every month, same every year. And all an app might get at the end of the year is a shiny new bell that you don’t need or won’t use.

There must be another way. There is, it’s called free software. It’s out there, you just have to know where to look. This site is here to help.

A small part of this site covers some of my experiences of having a stroke, albeit a minor one, a transient ischaemic attack or TIA for short.

I had it at around 9am on 27 April 2022. Time and date are firmly printed in memory; I just wish everything else was as easy to remember. I was just sitting around waiting to go to work. I’m self-employed if that explains why I was still at home at at that time.

My wife was upstairs. She’d asked me to get the broom out of my car. I stood up with what I thought was a dead leg. It wasn’t. I walked out to the car, steadying myself against the house. I came back with the broom, still leaning against the house. Walked through the back door and staggered to the couch. By this time my wife was downstairs. “What’s wrong with you?” she said. “I think I’m having a stroke,” was my reply.

This site tells my story since that time – what has happened, what to expect… If indeed, you can expect anything, because I’m told strokes affect everyone differently. But you might find some of it useful; I hope you do, but I hope you don’t have to.
