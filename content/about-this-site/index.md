For a while it seemed like Eleventy was going to be the home for this blog, but there were just too many issues; me for a start. Since having a stroke, I’ve been trying to do more. I got my blog back up and running in WordPress, my old stomping ground; that was an achievement in itself, but I wasn’t entirely satisfied. Far too many scripts going on for my liking. Page weight too heavy. Too many plugins. WP’s use of AI.

So I looked around at blogging frameworks and switched my sights to Eleventy. The end goal was to have this site served up as a static site, a bunch of plain old html files with CSS thrown in for good measure – as plaintext as you can get.

I got it up and running locally using Eleventy’s Base Blog, nothing more. But I faced issues here too. I don’t know Javascript or json or any of the other plethora of languages they talk about in the Eleventy Discord. I also didn’t know how to achieve a categories set-up in Eleventy, as in WP, even though plenty of people have. I got two distinct ‘sections’ up and running, articles and a blog, but that wasn’t enough. The documentation may be good for developers, but they’ll need to do a lot more if they want to attract the kind of simple people like me. Maybe they don’t. So I looked around some more.

That’s when I came across Zola. It sounded easier for me to cope with – no JS to worry about, or any of the other languages mentioned above. It’s just simple. Again the documentation could do with a bit if a polish, but aside from that it’s pretty much there. I got sections going again and feel comfortable enough with the system to create more when needed. So, Jeremy Prouillet – thank you!

There are no Webmentions on this blog. Even saying I could get them up and running, I’ve read too much about the cons as well as the pros. Nor are there any comments. I’ve been there in the past with WordPress and Disqus. All I can say is ‘spam’. It’s far too much to deal with aside from being a waste of time.
