So many people to thank… Where to start?

- The creator of [Zola](https://getzola.org), Jeremy Prouillet, the framework I used to build this site.
- The many digital gardens out there, including [ovi.design](https://www.ovl.design/) by Oscar and Jacob Leech’s [Digital Craftsman](https://jacobleech.com/). (If you like blogs, you’ve really got to go and look at their sites.) This is not a a digital garden, as such, more a place for me to experiment. I don’t like the phrase ‘digital garden’ anyway – sounds too like ‘walled garden’ and we all know what kind of prisons Facebook and Twitter have become.
- [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io), for my limited social presence and RSS feed icons; social media may soon become less important, as my interest in Bluesky wanes, but it remains for now. Who knows? It may come good.
- The fonts used are Fontin and Fontin Sans and they are courtesy of Jos Buivenga of [Exjlibris](https://exjlibris.com). For now.
- Use of the ‘before:2023’ search term to find old web answers to my questions. For the most part, it works. Try it. Just type `before:2023` before a search term. I simply have the phrase assigned to a snippet in [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) to speed up my typing.

I will add and subtract from this list as time goes on.
