So many people to thank… Where to start?

- The creator of [Zola](getzola.org), Jeremy Prouillet, for the framework I used to build this site. 
- The many digital gardens out there, including [ovi.design](https://www.ovl.design/) by Oscar and Jacob Leech’s [Digital Craftsman](https://jacobleech.com/). (If you like blogs, you’ve really got to go and look at their sites.) This is not a a digital garden, as such, more a place for me to experiment. I don’t like that phrase ‘digital garden’ anyway – sounds too like ‘walled garden’ and we all know what’s going on over on Facebook and Twitter.
- Fonts are Fontin and Fontin Sans, both by Jos Buivenga at [Exljbris](https://www.exljbris.com). Liberator, by [Lost Type Co-op](http://www.losttype.com), is used for the masthead on this blog.
- Use of the ‘before:2023’ search term to find old web answers to my questions. For the most part, it works. Try it. Just type `before:20203` before a search term. I simply have the phrase assigned to a snippet in [Alfred](alfredapp.com) to speed up my typing.

I will update this list as time goes on.
