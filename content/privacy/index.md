No legalese here. I am not a solicitor (read lawyer), nor am I involved in the legal profession in any other way. 

### Your data

I tried to avoid using any Javascript at all, but this site serves up one piece of JS from Piwik Pro. You can read more about their privacy policy over [here](https://help.piwik.pro/support/privacy/). But, let me say this, I would only take your data if you happened to be an oligarch and had a bigger super yacht than mine (joke). All I want to know is roughly how many people look at this website and what interests them, because that interests me.

There is nothing else. There are no secret police nor are there any spies lurking in the shadows, though you can never be too careful these days. 

### Web fonts

I use web fonts. All font files are served from this domain and there is no third party involved. If you have web fonts turned off, it does not load that stylesheet or the corresponding files, which should save you some bandwidth but not much. I think this site looks better with them, but you may see things differently.

### Links

You may occasionally come across links to Amazon. These may be affiliate links, they may not. All I can say is that I have keep this blog paid for some how and Amazon’s model suited me at the time.

### Email

Emails are kept private, especially when sent encrypted, but I may want to quote something you have written on occasion. If that happens, I’ll ask you. If you have emailed me about something you think I got wrong, I will ask if it’s okay to use your name to credit the correction.

I accept comments via email, Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter, and Signal, although with the latter you may notice a lag between your writing and me responding, as I have notifications switched off and rarely look at the app. I’m always interested in tips about free and open source software, and technology, and, for that matter, your comments about stroke or other writing that appear on this site. 

I take your privacy and confidentiality seriously.

Please [email me](/contact) if you have any questions.
